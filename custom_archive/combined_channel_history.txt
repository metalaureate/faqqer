Message: /faq block height 
--------------------------------------------------
Channel: OrderOfSoon | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-05-31 11:01:59
Message: The block height refers to the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding a particular block. It is essentially the length of the blockchain from the genesis block to the current block. Each new block added to the blockchain increases the block height by one. (Replying to: /faq block height)

Message: On one of my vast.ai ubuntu instances the TU screen goes blank after a few hours. As far as l can tell from 'top' and 'nvidia-smi' th various tari processes are all running and mining is still happening. This is the second time this has happened today and I am reluctant to restart it as that can be a very, very lengthy process with the present state of the software. Has anyone else seen this?

Message: Tari Universe is a desktop application for mining Tari on Mac or PC. It simplifies the mining process with one-click setup and installation, a clean interface, automatic updates, and a built-in wallet. Tari supports merge mining with Monero using the Minotari Miner, allowing simultaneous mining of both Minotari and Monero. The Hatchling pool is a low-fee, centralized pool available to the Tari community, designed to improve the win frequency for small miners. For more detailed instructions on mining, you can use xmrig via command line or HiveOS as outlined in the FAQ. (Replying to: /faq mining)
