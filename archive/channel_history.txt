Message: The block height refers to the current block number in the blockchain. In the Tari network, 720 blocks are mined per day, with each block taking an average of about 2 minutes to mine. You can check the current block height by visiting https://explore-nextnet.tari.com/. If your block height is very low (e.g., under 100), you may be mining on an incorrect chain.

Message: Hmm ok - running a search on the block explorer page of a block I was rewarded for (which doesn't seem to search collapsed sections, so i went through each one just to be sure i wasnt missing it somewhere), for "PUB_KEY" doesn't bring anything up... and neither does my wallet address.

Actually, PUB_KEY doesn't exist anywhere in text, anywhere in the Local or Roaming → /.com.universe.tari folders either...

A search for "pub" in the Block Explorer gets me:

Public Nonce (under "Kernels")
Ephemeral pubkey (under "Output")
Sender Offset Public Key (under "Output")

None of which have text which i can identify as being related to me or my wallet...

Am I looking in the wrong place?

Message: If you see your tXTM drop to zero after a restart, you may have been mining previously on orphan chains. Orphan chains happen when the miner can't sync with the network.

Built as a **layer-2 network on Monero**, Tari offers decentralized digital asset management with built-in **confidentiality**.

Message: The transaction fees on the Tari network are expected to be low and efficient, with most user activity happening on a scalable digital asset layer. This ensures fast, low-cost transactions while maintaining privacy and decentralization through a secure Proof-of-Work base layer. By separating operations between layers, Tari can balance affordability and scalability, keeping fees predictable and competitive for users engaging with digital assets like NFTs (Replying to: what are tx fees gonna be like)

Message: Mining rewards are given when you successfully mine a block. The frequency of receiving tXTM rewards depends on your hardware and the current network hashrate. It can vary greatly depending on your hardware and luck. If you're mining on the testnet, starting from October 2nd, mining will earn you Gems in the Tari Airdrop Game, which will be related to mainnet rewards. (Replying to: /faq when do I get txtm reward)

--------------------------------------------------
User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2024-10-16 22:32:58
Message: The block height refers to the current position in the blockchain. The Tari chain mines 720 blocks a day, each taking an average of about 2 minutes to mine. If your block height is very low (e.g., under 100), you may be mining on an incorrect chain. You can check the current block height by visiting https://explore-nextnet.tari.com/. If you notice discrepancies, it might be due to network issues, and you may need to restart the application to sync correctly. (Replying to: /faq block height)

Message: Mining freezing at 75% could be due to several reasons, such as network connectivity issues or system resource limitations. Try restarting the application or checking your network connection. If the problem persists, it may be a known issue that the developers are working on.

Message: /faq block 
--------------------------------------------------
User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2024-10-17 11:16:42
Message: Here are some relevant points about blocks in Tari Universe:

1. **How often are new blocks mined in the Tari network?**
   - 720 per day. Each block takes a few minutes to mine before moving on to the next block.

2. **What do the numbers up the side of the screen mean?**
   - This indicates your current block height. The Tari chain mines 720 blocks a day, each taking an average of about 2 minutes to mine.

3. **What do the red exploding blocks mean?**
   - The red block explosion indicates you didn't win a block. Keep mining--it can take some time to win tXTM.

4. **What should I do if I am mining at the wrong block height?**
   - Since none of your tXTM earnings count if you are not mining at the tip, you can safely delete all application files.

5. **How do I delete all system application files?**
   - On Windows, delete the com.tari.universe folder in:
     - C:\users\<name>\AppData\Local\com.tari.universe
     - C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\com.tari.universe\
   - On Mac:
     - Library/Application Support/com.tari.universe/
     - Library/caches/com.tari.universe
     - Library/logs/com.tari.universe

6. **What is the current block height?**
   - If your block height is very low (e.g., under 100), you may be mining on an incorrect chain. (Replying to: /faq block)

Message: Ok so here is a block I partially won: @NinjaPhil 

https://textexplore-nextnet.tari.com/blocks/25106

To find my output, I take my Tari wallet key and de-hash it:
(`pip install base58`)
```

import base58
# Example Base58 encoded string
base58_string = "32Mfqu4XtsKvURUDqv4rrF6xKydFZ8QVafzcWSmJUGVmoJzhACehKpMFgPBtnu4ZwxU2gYhVCnpbZWKqNphRNA1Txr"  # Replace with your Tari Wallet address
# Step 1: Decode the Base58 string to bytes
decoded_bytes = base58.b58decode(base58_string)
# Step 2: Convert the decoded bytes to a hex string
hex_string = decoded_bytes.hex()
print(f"Hex Encoded: {hex_string}")
# Step 3: Ignore the checksum at the end (last two characters), and take the next 4 characters 
```
`Hex Encoded: 0531e130127666886d6740160198be32fad2359f1b8c0da017cbad6f204f179f7d6e1aecf241f051b23dc04f716f0e30dbf135ada5eb23ecdb90ec8a05417e3008ff`
So take `3008`and look up the output that matches--seen in screenshot.

Message: The 'no version selected' error might be related to installation or configuration issues. Please ensure that you have the correct version of Tari Universe installed for your operating system. If the issue persists, try reinstalling the application or contact support staff for further assistance. (Replying to: /faq no version selected error)

User: MrMooning | Date: 2024-10-18 12:45:59
Message: The 'no version selected' error might be related to a corrupt client or installation issue. Try renaming the application folders as follows: 

For Windows: 
- Rename C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\com.tari.universe to C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\DOTcom.tari.universe
- Rename C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\com.tari.universe\ to C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\DOTcom.tari.universe\

Ensure there are no zombie Tari processes running in Task Manager and check if msiexec.exe is running. If it is, kill the process, and reinstall. If the issue persists, this question will be forwarded to support staff for further assistance. (Replying to: Not working I downloaded with you link)

Message: Hi!
I've the same issue on Win machine
1. There weren't any tari processes (& subprocesses);
2. Killed msiexec.exe (idk why it isn't killed itself after installation/update);
3. Renameв folders placed at AppData and Roaming

After Tari Universe launch there were created com.tari.universe folders again at both AppData and Roaming instead of looking at renamed folders. Is it expected?
(self-answer - looks like "yes" cuz it's looking for these folders and didn't found them cuz rename so created them again) (Replying to: https://t.me/OrderOfSoon/15108)
