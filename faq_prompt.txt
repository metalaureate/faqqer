Eco mode is designed for background mining with lower resource usage, while Ludicrous mode is for dedicated mining with higher resource usage.
3. Can I mine with both CPU and GPU?
Yes, Tari Universe supports both CPU and GPU mining. You can choose to use one or both in the settings.
4. What is p2pool mining?
P2pool (peer-to-peer pool) is a decentralized mining pool. It allows miners to combine their hashpower and share rewards more frequently.
5. How do I enable p2pool mining?
As of the latest updates, p2pool mining should be enabled by default. However, it's still being optimized and may not be fully functional yet.
6. How often should I expect to receive mining rewards?
This depends on your hardware and the current network hashrate. Rewards are given when you successfully mine a block, not on a fixed schedule. The frequency can vary greatly depending on your hardware and luck.
7. How can I optimize my mining performance?
For CPU mining on Windows, running Tari Universe as administrator can provide a boost. Also, ensure you have enough free RAM (at least 2.5GB for CPU mining). In general, closing any other applications running will help.
8. Is there a way to customize mining intensity beyond Eco and Ludicrous modes?
Currently, there isn't, but a "custom mode" allowing more granular control over mining settings is planned for a future update.
9. Is there a limit to how many devices I can mine on?
No, there doesn't appear to be a limit. @MrMooning confirmed: "Yes you can mine on as many devices as you'd like"
10. How does Tari Universe handle multiple GPUs?
Tari Universe can use multiple GPUs, but some users are reporting issues with GPU selection, especially for those with multiple GPUs.
11. How does Tari's mining algorithm work?
Tari uses a hybrid Proof of Work system. @sparkslice explained: "Tari uses a hybrid Proof of Work system so it makes use of both! 50% of blocks are mined using RandomX and 50% of blocks are mined using SHA3"
12. How often are new blocks mined in the Tari network?
720 per day. Each block takes a few minutes to mine before moving on the next block.
13. Is there a way to mine Monero (XMR) concurrently with Tari?
@sparkslice mentioned: "we will add XMR support in before mainnet so you can mine XMR concurrent to Tari"
14. Can I mine Tari on mobile devices?
No, Tari Universe is currently only for desktop operating systems.
15. Is there a way to run Tari Universe without a GUI?
While Tari Universe is designed with a GUI, some users asked about running it on servers without X installed. This doesn't seem to be officially supported, but building from source might allow for this.
16. What do the numbers up the side of the screen mean?
This indicates your current block height. The Tari chain mines 720 blocks a day, each taking an average of about 2 minutes to mine.
17. What do the red exploding blocks mean?
The red block explosion indicates you didn't win a block. Keep mining--it can take some time to win tXTM.
18. How do GPU and CPU mining compare in Tari?
Tari uses two different algorithms: 50% of blocks are mined with CPU, 50% with GPU. Hash rates for CPU and GPU are not directly comparable due to the different algorithms.

Wallet and Rewards:

1. What is tXTM?
tXTM is the testnet token for Tari. It has no real value and is used for testing purposes.
2. Why is my wallet balance showing zero?
This could be due to a few reasons:
    1. You haven't mined any blocks yet.
    2. There may be a temporary display issue.
    3. There was a network reset.
    4. You may be mining on an incorrect chain if not properly connected to the Tari network.
    @possumously mentioned: "Wallet shows 0 when it is undefined. We need to change that."
3. How can I view my wallet seed phrase?
You should be able to view your seed phrase in the settings. Go to ⚙️ -> Mining -> Seed Words
4. Can I use the same wallet on multiple machines?
Yes, you can. @stringhandler provided steps to do this.
5. Is there a way to see transaction history in Tari Universe?
As of the latest discussed version, there isn't. @sparkslice confirmed this is a planned feature: "re tx history, yes this is a missing feature for now, but is on the list!"
6. What are the latest GPU mining benchmarks for Tari?
As mentioned by @possumously, the latest GPU mining benchmarks can be found at: [https://www.notion.so/tarilabs/GPU-Mining-Benchmarks-10b4e6c995c38033b4bac5ed9ed6cc2b](https://www.notion.so/GPU-Mining-Benchmarks-10b4e6c995c38033b4bac5ed9ed6cc2b?pvs=21)
7. What should I do if my estimated earnings seem inaccurate?
This was listed as a known issue in one of the updates. If your estimated earnings seem off, it's likely a bug that the team is working on fixing. It's best to mine for a full 24 hrs before concluding that the estimate is off.
8. Will mining on testnet count towards mainnet rewards?
No, testnet mining (tXTM) has no direct relation to mainnet Tari. However, starting from October 2nd, mining on testnet will earn you Gems in the Tari Airdrop Game, which will be related to mainnet rewards.
9. When will mining rewards be connected to the Tari Airdrop Game?
Incentivized testnet will begin October 2nd, 2024.
10. What is the Tari Airdrop Game?
The Tari Airdrop Game is a way to earn Gems by mining and inviting friends. These Gems will be related to mainnet rewards in the future.
11. What is the Tari Aurora wallet?
Tari Aurora is the mobile wallet app for Tari. It allows you to view your Tari balance and transactions but does not support mining. Users can import their mining wallet to the Tari Aurora mobile wallet to check balances.
12. What is the Tari Store?
The Tari Store is briefly mentioned as a place where users can get exclusive collectibles using their tXTM. However, no further details are provided in this conversation.
13. How much tXTM do I win?
You are in a pool with other miners and if you win, your tXTM is proportional to the hash power you contributed to mining that block.
14. Why is my balance fluctuating?
Some users reported their balance going up and down. This might be due to network resets or other temporary issues. If you notice significant discrepancies, please report them to the team.
15. How do Gems relate to tXTM?
1 tXTM = 25 gems. There is a cap of 50,000 gems per block that you can win. Gems are the important metric for the airdrop, not tXTM.
