Message: Hi All, welcome to The Order of Soon, the Tari Universe beta club :). Everyone here has been testing early versions of Tari Universe. Firstly, thank you for being our guinea pigs. We greatly appreciate it! 

Second, there is a new build coming TODAY with some big new features: design tweaks across the board, GPU support, and MORE

We'd love your help installing it, and testing it. In fact, we plan on releasing a new build daily this week leading up to Thursday. Thank you so much for all of your feedback, help and support with all things Tari and Tari Universe. We can't wait to hear what you think about the new builds this week 🙂

 TARI UNIVERSE PRE-RELEASE BETA
          v.0.2.8
==================================

Thank you friends of Soon for helping us harden the app for general release. If you successfully install/update please thumbs up, if you don't please thumbs down and we will DM you individually to help troubleshoot.

==================================
     RELEASE NOTES SUMMARY
==================================

1. Analytics and analytics permissions (in sync and settings)
   - Includes hidden gems backend update mechanisms
2. UI improvements and animation bug fixes
3. First round of Settings cleanup
4. P2Pool improvements (not yet enabled by default)

==================================
 KNOWN ISSUES WE'RE WORKING ON ASAP
==================================

1. Windows may display "unknown publisher" warnings (code signing certificates will be included in the next build) *
2. This build may not be backwards compatible with older versions *
   - If you encounter issues, you may need to Reset Settings (located at the bottom of the Settings screen)
3. Some UI messages may briefly display missing internationalization (i18n) strings *
4. Extended delay during block syncing and P2Pool operations (being addressed by the base layer contributors). Takes 3-5 minutes to sync. *
5. P2Pool is disabled by default until stabilized
6. Block win success animation sometimes does not play *
7. Older versions of Mac (pre Sonoma) may not display animations correctly
8. Anti-Virus protection may erroneously flag some components--it is safe to Allow them (working on versions that don't trigger these alarms)

* = fixed in tomorrow's build

==================================
         DOWNLOAD LINKS
==================================

Message: ==================================
     TARI UNIVERSE v0.2.10
==================================

Freshh build! This build should auto update if you close and re-open (next build won't require you to do that). (Some of you have already done this!)

INSTALLERS:

Windows: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_x64_en-US.msi
Mac: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_universal.dmg

==================================
         WHAT'S NEW
==================================

1. Auto update should update the app (have to close and open it--next build will prompt you without needing to close the app)
2. Code-signed packages for Windows
3. Fixed the block success animation
4. Startup sync improvements, shorter/more informative
5. Round 2 of Settings UI improvements
6. Tower shadows track local sun position (to surprise and delight)
7. No-click mining
8. p2pool improvements behind the scenes
9. Telemetry bug fixes

==================================
        KNOWN ISSUES
==================================

1. p2pool still stabilizing (off by default, in Settings)
2. Some sun positions expose weird graphical artifacts in the tower animation
3. Your mileage on Linux may vary at the moment (and does not support auto update)
4. Older (than Sonoma) Mac OSes exhibit issues with animations

NEXT BUILD IS TOMORROW!

Message: thank you for the feedback! re point 1, our attitude is this: every click a user makes is a miracle. Reducing clicks is always the way to make things easy. If you are opening the software, your intent is to mine, so lets just get right to it and save you the time

re 2: yes we should be able to add this in the settings. @possumously @stringhandler 

re 3: yes this should already be in the settings otherwise we can def add it. Agree with you

re 4: so there is a trade off with the graphics. The intent of this product is accessibility and creating an emotional connection for folks with Tari, which we hope the graphics help us achieve. It is definitely NOT the MOST optimized way to mine. Thats where the command line tools come in. We've debated the idea of including a version that allows you to turn off the graphics and what we settled on is this: when you minimize it, the graphics turn off and you get max performance. When its on your screen, the graphics are on and you get a small performance penalty (Replying to: Few things i personally don't like / would like to see change:

Message: just a heads up on how tomorrow is going to go. We are going to invite the top 1000 folks off the waitlist. Everyone is also going to be given 5 VIP codes to invite friends. Those codes will get them guaranteed access to Batch #2. 

Our goal for Batch #2 is to have Tari Airdrop game support added. In other words.. we are launching an incentivized testnet. You will earn (a fuck ton) of Airdrop game Gems by mining the Tari testnet. You will earn even more by inviting friends

1. Windows may display "unknown publisher" warnings (code signing certificates will be included in the next build) *
2. This build may not be backwards compatible with older versions *
   - If you encounter issues, you may need to Reset Settings (located at the bottom of the Settings screen)
3. Some UI messages may briefly display missing internationalization (i18n) strings *
4. Extended delay during block syncing and P2Pool operations (being addressed by the base layer contributors). Takes 3-5 minutes to sync. *
5. P2Pool is disabled by default until stabilized
6. Block win success animation sometimes does not play *
7. Older versions of Mac (pre Sonoma) may not display animations correctly
8. Anti-Virus protection may erroneously flag some components--it is safe to Allow them (working on versions that don't trigger these alarms)

* = fixed in tomorrow's build

     TARI UNIVERSE v0.2.10
==================================

Freshh build! This build should auto update if you close and re-open (next build won't require you to do that). (Some of you have already done this!)

INSTALLERS:

Windows: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_x64_en-US.msi
Mac: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_universal.dmg

==================================
         WHAT'S NEW
==================================

1. Auto update should update the app (have to close and open it--next build will prompt you without needing to close the app)
2. Code-signed packages for Windows
3. Fixed the block success animation
4. Startup sync improvements, shorter/more informative
5. Round 2 of Settings UI improvements
6. Tower shadows track local sun position (to surprise and delight)
7. No-click mining
8. p2pool improvements behind the scenes
9. Telemetry bug fixes

==================================
        KNOWN ISSUES
==================================

1. p2pool still stabilizing (off by default, in Settings)
2. Some sun positions expose weird graphical artifacts in the tower animation
3. Your mileage on Linux may vary at the moment (and does not support auto update)
4. Older (than Sonoma) Mac OSes exhibit issues with animations

NEXT BUILD IS TOMORROW!)

You've given us incredible feedback and we are working hard to make updates. The next few weeks will be big for Tari Universe:

next week - we hope to ship a more stable version of p2pool. This means you will earn tXTM rewards more frequently as you will be automatically connected to a decentralized pool! 

9/24 - we are planning on shipping an update that will connect Tari Universe to the Tari Airdrop Game. This means you will be able to earn Airdrop gems by mining and referring friends to Tari Universe! ALPHA: The # of Gems you will be able to earn will be HUGE!

Also: if we own multiple machines running nodes, will we be flagged as cybil for linking different wallets to one airdrop account? Or can all the miners point towards one wallet in the future?

Message: Great question! No, tXTM has no value and no connection to mainnet tokens. This is really just for testing the software, and getting feedback from the community as we move closer towards mainnet.

That being said, starting on 9/24, we will feature on Tari Universe where you can earn Tari Airdrop Game gems through mining and via invites. At this point in time we dont expect there being any limits to how many computers etc. you run this on as the goal is to simulate a real-world mining like experience with Airdrop Gems pre mainnet launch. We will have more details on exactly how this will all work on 9/24 (assuming we dont run into any showstopper bugs of course!)

The new animation (seems a bit fast with the cube movement) in the pause mining, maybe an emoji here and there can be added to some of the rings besides the cube

As there are similar rings on the wallet balance area, will we see some animation added there?

## What is Tari Universe? 🌌

Tari Universe is the world's first no-clicks-required desktop mining app. It's designed for everyone to earn Tari by contributing hash power to the Tari network, claiming their stake in a new internet of digital freedom and possibility. 💪

## Key Features 🔑

- ⚡ Instant Mining: Start mining testnet immediately with zero setup required
- 🎨 Visual Experience: Stunning visualizations of your network contribution
- 🔧 Flexible Resource Usage: Choose between Ludicrous mode (dedicated) or Eco mode (background) for CPU/GPU utilization

## What's Next? 🔮

We're continuously improving Tari Universe. In the coming weeks, expect regular updates with bug fixes and new features as we prepare for mainnet. Stay tuned for pool mining, which will democratize blockchain mining by allowing all computers to earn Tari through combined hash power and split rewards. 🤝

Join us in shaping the future of digital freedom. Welcome to the Tari Universe! 🌟)

Message: Hi jake question: why wouldnt you want to use gpu for mining? (Replying to: Just updated my miner to 3.3, 

The settings saved from previous, so that’s amazing. Confident it won’t just turn on my GPU to mine again

The new animation (seems a bit fast with the cube movement) in the pause mining, maybe an emoji here and there can be added to some of the rings besides the cube

As there are similar rings on the wallet balance area, will we see some animation added there?

Looks so clean. Still wondering if and how Tari Universe could play into a rainmeter app integration)

If you are trying to make it a friendly experience, you may want to add a simple install mode that most will use. Then offer an advanced install mode where you can flag one client as the proxy node, then cluster the clients against the node. 

Also, I created a windows bootdisk for one of my ai machines. When running it with more than three GPU's it won't run.

Message: Anyone else run into a Universe client that is not active, but still showing the visual? I noticed the gpu was at 5% and didnt have any luck overnight. 

There should be a means to view if the client is connected to Tor,  proxy, node, etc. Some people will not notice the 5% gpu and let it run for days since the animation shows it is working.

Message: You can try `which tari-universe` or just run `tari-universe` (Replying to: Hey Mike, thank you. We want to run tari on a dedicated server but I can’t see any CLI commands to run it. 
Also, what’s the ubuntu version required to run it and what are the dependencies? 

Thank you in advance)

Message: so almost twice as much hashpower.. but no blocks mined all night (my wallet has not gotten a reward). Swuad tab is populating though with some good info. Strange because I am definitely using RandomX but don't seem to be giving any input lol (Replying to: I need some volunteers to run p2pool for a bit. If you're interested: Stop mining. Go to experimental settings. Turn on p2pool. RESTART TARI UNIVERSE. Then leave it mining)

Message: seems stuck on one block even though CPU was going up. Could make sense since I had GPU turned off. Restarted the app twice now, doesn't seem to be getting back online. Will try turning CPU off and only run gpu for a bit
