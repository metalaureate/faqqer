Message: The 'no version selected' error might be related to a corrupt client or installation issue. Try renaming the application folders as follows: 

For Windows: 
- Rename C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\com.tari.universe to C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\DOTcom.tari.universe
- Rename C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\com.tari.universe\ to C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\DOTcom.tari.universe\

Ensure there are no zombie Tari processes running in Task Manager and check if msiexec.exe is running. If it is, kill the process, and reinstall. If the issue persists, this question will be forwarded to support staff for further assistance. (Replying to: Not working I downloaded with you link)

I've the same issue on Win machine
1. There weren't any tari processes (& subprocesses);
2. Killed msiexec.exe (idk why it isn't killed itself after installation/update);
3. Renameв folders placed at AppData and Roaming

After Tari Universe launch there were created com.tari.universe folders again at both AppData and Roaming instead of looking at renamed folders. Is it expected?
(self-answer - looks like "yes" cuz it's looking for these folders and didn't found them cuz rename so created them again) (Replying to: https://t.me/OrderOfSoon/15108)

Message: Rewards are given when you successfully mine a block. The frequency of receiving rewards can vary greatly depending on your hardware and luck. You are in a pool with other miners, and if you win, your tXTM is proportional to the hash power you contributed to mining that block. (Replying to: /faq How are rewards paid?)

Message: # **🌪️ Release Storm Update 🌪️**

Hi fam, contributors have worked 24/7 over the past week to make enormous under-the-hood changes to Tari Universe. With the release of 0.5.39**,** we’ve made massive progress and now have a clear path forward. The biggest challenge we are currently working through is with nodes. The Monero nodes we’ve been using aren’t working reliably, making CPU mining highly intermittent for most members of the Tari community. We have a plan to solve this and are working on it as we speak. Other things we are working on:

1. P2Pool network connectivity improvements - while the core p2pool work has made huge leaps forward, network connectivity challenges still prevent it from working smoothly. Expect updates on this front this coming week.
2. Missing gems - we expect to complete this work by midweek. Thank you for your patience here on this front!

We know it's frustrating when Tari Universe is working inconsistently. Our top priority is to make it smooth as butter for everyone as quickly as possible. Thank you for being a Tari OG, for helping to test Tari Universe, for your feedback, and passion for all things Tari. Stay tuned for more updates Soon™  💜🐢

PS: We will return to more formal release notes starting tomorrow or Tuesday. We know these are helpful and will also add a space for them in the app itself.

Message: # **🌪️ Release Storm Update 🌪️**

Hi everyone, the storm continues! 0.5.42 is rolling out by auto-update NOW. This update introduces breaking changes to p2pool, so we kindly ask everyone to update 🙏🏾

What’s changed? We’ve introduced a hard fork to p2pool, meaning only TU 0.5.42 installs can talk to each other and form a pool. We’re hopeful this creates a far more reliable pool sync experience and helps address the intermittent CPU and GPU mining challenges many of you have reported.  We’ll be hovering over our dashboards and analyzing the telemetry and will report back tomorrow!

Thank you again for all your patience and support fam. We are making great progress and will reach our dream destination Soon™: A world where Tari Universe “just works” for everyone! 💜🐢

Message: So i have to stop running it for now then? (Replying to: Hi, its not about complaining or no. Your hashpower is really low and around 160 txtm estimated per day
1 block gives you 13k txtm. So you can see that you need to try mining for many weeks until you get lucky to win a block)

Message: I encountered something which also somehow related issue above on 0.5.42 - after app start CPU hashrate is showing and after some time get's replaced by infinite spinner and only app restart helps to display CPU hashrate again
Also on 0.5.42 there is no wins for about 10 hours but on 0.5.41 participation in winning blocks were 1 per hour approximately

(maybe it will help somehow in further investigations)
