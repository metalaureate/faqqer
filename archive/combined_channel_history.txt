Hi everyone,

Welcome to day 24 of Tari mainnet! We feel so grateful to be contributing to this revolutionary protocol with all of you. This was a big week for all of us. Together we shipped:

- Hard fork part 1!
- hatchling pool + Tari Universe integration
- Tari bridge and wXTM powered by LayerZero OFT
- lots of other small updates and tweaks!

Contributors worked tirelessly to make it all happen, and we are incredibly proud of their hard work and efforts. As we head into the weekend, we wanted to share the bugs and issues that are at the top of our list to fix ASAP next week:

🔧 Top Bugs and Issues

- 📱Tari Universe Mobile - We are aware that many of you are experiencing issues with syncing, transactions disappearing, and payment ID challenges with exchanges. Our goal is to squash these bugs asap this coming week, so the mobile apps become everyone's preferred way to transact
- 🌉wXTM Bridge - This new feature shipped as an MVP, and there are a number of mission-critical things we’re working on fixing including: the dreaded “forever” transaction pending modal, providing better feedback when a transaction fails, and improving bridge performance and overall reliability
- 🔗Network Sync - We know many of you run into a variety of challenges around network sync, including getting stuck at “Setting up Tari Node 3/5" and Tari Universe displaying the wrong block height. A new version of Tari base node that we hope will solve these challenges is prepped and ready for release early this coming week!
- ⚖️ Wallet Balance Synchronization - Thank you to everyone who shared feedback on the current version of Tari Universe wallet. We’ve spent significant time refactoring and improving this feature to enhance sync performance, better communicate transaction states, and more. These updates will ship very soon!

And more..! 

Thank you to everyone who’s given us feedback, shared screenshots, and submitted logs for contributors to parse. Together, we will make Tari the most useful, beautiful, and easiest to use protocol in the world 💜🐢

1- total Hashrate of the network increasing daily
2- more miners
3- blocks giving less XTM now ( started with ~13980, now around 13700)
4- CPU currently solves 2/3 of the blocks, gpu only 1/3… in the second phase it will go back to half half ( with different algos)

Message: You're absolutely right — price does matter.
After all, we all hope our efforts are rewarded. That’s only natural.

But Tari isn’t chasing short-term pumps or hype.
It’s quietly building a network that respects privacy, fairness, and open participation.
A system like that takes time — time to grow, time to earn trust, time to last.

Tari is building a sustainable and inclusive network where everyone has a place.
GPU miners are not forgotten — they remain an essential part of this vision. (Replying to: You released a v2 and ruined everything.

--------------------------------------------------
Channel: OrderOfSoon | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-05-31 11:01:59
Message: The block height refers to the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding a particular block. It is essentially the length of the blockchain from the genesis block to the current block. Each new block added to the blockchain increases the block height by one. (Replying to: /faq block height)

Is there any option in the program to set the path for it's data?
I have created a link and it works, but it would be nice to set this path in the app it self. I run out of space and I had to search for the app path...

As far as l can tell from 'top' and 'nvidia-smi' th various tari processes are all running and mining is still happening.

Message: Tari Universe is a desktop application for mining Tari on Mac or PC. It simplifies the mining process with one-click setup and installation, a clean interface, automatic updates, and a built-in wallet. Tari supports merge mining with Monero using the Minotari Miner, allowing simultaneous mining of both Minotari and Monero. The Hatchling pool is a low-fee, centralized pool available to the Tari community, designed to improve the win frequency for small miners. For more detailed instructions on mining, you can use xmrig via command line or HiveOS as outlined in the FAQ. (Replying to: /faq mining)
