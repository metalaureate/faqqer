Message: 🚀 TARI UNIVERSE v1.6.1: Hotfix — The Kingdom of All Waters Part 2

🔄 Rolling out via auto-update

Hey Tari fam,

🐓 Following up on the workaround we shared before the hard fork at block 95,000: this hotfix resolves the C29 pool address bug. If you didn't manage to apply the workaround in time, no worries—LuckyPool temporarily redirected the SHA-3 pool to C29 so you didn't miss out. With this update, Tari Universe now automatically defaults to the correct C29 pool address.

✨ WHAT'S FIXED

- 🎯 Correct C29 Pool Connection – Tari Universe now automatically connects to the right Cuckaroo29 pool address without any manual setup needed.
- ⚡ Faster GPU Switching  – When your GPU needs to switch miners, it now happens in 3 minutes instead of 30. 
- 🔧 Smarter GPU Management – Better fallback logic means if one GPU miner isn't working, the app intelligently switches to the best alternative for your hardware.
- 🌐 Pool Stats Fix – Fixed the SHA-3x pool stats display so you can track your mining progress accurately.

Back to mining, everyone! 💜🐢

Not sure what youre talking about here. You'd have to look at all lanes to determine if there is a centralization challenge. There are so many folks mining Tari across all these lanes. (Replying to: Why mislead by talking about decentralization when all your eggs are in one basket?)
