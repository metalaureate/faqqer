# Tari Universe FAQs
Updated: Tuesday September 17th 2024


1. What is Tari Universe?

Tari Universe is described by @sparkslice as "the world's first no-clicks-required desktop mining app. It's designed for everyone to earn Tari by contributing hash power to the Tari network, claiming their stake in a new internet of digital freedom and possibility."

2. What platforms is Tari Universe available on?

Tari Universe is currently available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is not available for mobile devices.

3. What is the current version of Tari Universe?

As of the latest messages, the current version is 0.3.3.

4. How do I start mining with Tari Universe?

Simply download and install the application. Mining starts automatically when you open the app.

5. What are the two mining modes in Tari Universe?

There are two modes:
- Eco mode: For background mining with lower resource usage
- Ludicrous mode: For dedicated mining with higher resource usage

6. What is tXTM?

tXTM is the testnet token for Tari. It has no real value and is used for testing purposes only.

7. Why is my tXTM balance showing zero even though I've been mining?

@sparkslice explains: "Mining is super competitive rn so it's hard to win. We are shipping an update early next week that includes a feature called p2pool. This feature will enable everyone to join a decentralized pool and make it a lot easier to win portions of blocks!"

8. What is p2pool and how will it help?

P2pool is a decentralized mining pool. @sparkslice states: "P2pool will really help level the playing field with regards to earning tXTM for mining because it means that everyone will be connected to a pool, and everyone can earn some tXTM based on their computational contribution vs. the winner take all model that currently exists with solo mining."

9. When will p2pool be available?

The team is aiming to release a stable version of p2pool in the week of September 17, 2024.

10. How does Tari Universe relate to the Tari Airdrop Game?

@sparkslice explains: "Starting on 9/24, we will be shipping an update that will connect Tari Universe to the Tari Airdrop Game. This means you will be able to earn Airdrop gems by mining and referring friends to Tari Universe!"

11. Will mining before 9/24 count towards the airdrop?

No, mining before the integration with the Airdrop Game will not count towards gem earnings.

12. What mining algorithms does Tari use?

Tari uses a hybrid Proof of Work system. @sparkslice states: "Tari uses a hybrid Proof of Work system so it makes use of both [CPU and GPU]! 50% of blocks are mined using RandomX and 50% of blocks are mined using SHA3."

13. Can I mine Tari Universe on multiple devices?

Yes, you can install and run Tari Universe on multiple devices.

14. How can I check if I'm connected to the Tari network?

As of the latest messages, there isn't a clear way to check network connection status. @stringhandler mentions: "There's a guy here who asks me every day for connected status, so we'll have to add it soon."

15. Why does my antivirus flag Tari Universe as a threat?

This is a false positive. @uforiaio explains: "Several mainstream malware packages can drop monero miners, so it's a common indicator of compromise. It's a false positive."

16. How can I increase my mining power?

The most straightforward way is to use a more powerful GPU. Overclocking is possible but not recommended unless you're very experienced.

17. Is there a way to mine Tari without the graphical interface?

Currently, there isn't an official CLI version of Tari Universe. The focus is on the GUI application.

18. Will there be a mobile version of Tari Universe?

There are no plans announced for a mobile version. Mining is resource-intensive and not suitable for mobile devices.

19. How are mining rewards distributed?

Currently, with solo mining, you only receive rewards if you solve a block first. With the upcoming p2pool feature, rewards will be distributed more frequently based on your contribution to the pool.

20. What should I do if Tari Universe crashes or won't start?

Common troubleshooting steps include:
- Ensuring you have the latest version
- Checking for antivirus interference
- Resetting the application in Settings
- Checking your internet connection

21. What are the system requirements for Tari Universe?

Specific system requirements aren't provided, but it's mentioned that the application can run on standard PCs and Macs. More powerful hardware will provide better mining performance.

22. Is there a dark mode for Tari Universe?

Not currently, but it has been requested by users and acknowledged by the team.

23. What's the difference between mining with CPU and GPU?

Both CPU (RandomX) and GPU (SHA3) are used for mining in Tari. Generally, GPUs provide more hash power, but the relative profitability depends on the current network conditions.

24. How can I contribute to Tari Universe's development?

Users are encouraged to provide feedback, report bugs, and test new features like p2pool. The development team is actively incorporating user feedback into updates.

25. When will Tari Universe move from testnet to mainnet?

No specific date for mainnet launch has been announced. The focus is currently on improving the testnet version and integrating with the Airdrop Game.


26. What are VIP codes and how do they work?

VIP codes are used to grant early access to Tari Universe. @GhastlyPack explains: "Universe itself won't [require a code] but to access our code-locked download page you will... Atm only people we've invited to this chat have the download link."

27. How often are updates released for Tari Universe?

During the beta testing phase, updates are frequent. @sparkslice mentions: "There will be several releases over the next week as we make updates based on the issues reported + some new features we are working on."

33. How does Tari Universe impact computer performance for other tasks?

The impact depends on the mining mode and your hardware. Users can pause mining or use Eco mode to reduce resource usage when needed.

34. Is there a maximum number of devices I can use to mine Tari?

There's no mentioned limit on the number of devices. @sparkslice states: "At this point in time we dont expect there being any limits to how many computers etc. you run this on."

35. What is the block win animation?

There's a visual animation when a user successfully mines a block. @sparkslice asks users: "Anyone experience the new block win animation?? üíúüê¢"

36. Is there a sound effect when mining a block?

There are conflicting reports about sound effects. @sparkslice initially stated there were no sound effects, but later said, "they may have built sound into this version."

37. How can I view my mining logs?

Users can access logs through the Settings menu. @stringhandler instructs: "you can open logs directory from Settings."

38. Will mining Tari generate heat on my device?

Yes, mining can cause devices to heat up. Several users reported increased temperatures and fan activity while mining.

39. Is there a way to schedule mining times?
