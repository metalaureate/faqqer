Message: Hi All, welcome to The Order of Soon, the Tari Universe beta club :). Everyone here has been testing early versions of Tari Universe. Firstly, thank you for being our guinea pigs. We greatly appreciate it! 

Second, there is a new build coming TODAY with some big new features: design tweaks across the board, GPU support, and MORE

We'd love your help installing it, and testing it. In fact, we plan on releasing a new build daily this week leading up to Thursday. Thank you so much for all of your feedback, help and support with all things Tari and Tari Universe. We can't wait to hear what you think about the new builds this week 🙂

 TARI UNIVERSE PRE-RELEASE BETA
          v.0.2.8
==================================

Thank you friends of Soon for helping us harden the app for general release. If you successfully install/update please thumbs up, if you don't please thumbs down and we will DM you individually to help troubleshoot.

==================================
     RELEASE NOTES SUMMARY
==================================

1. Analytics and analytics permissions (in sync and settings)
   - Includes hidden gems backend update mechanisms
2. UI improvements and animation bug fixes
3. First round of Settings cleanup
4. P2Pool improvements (not yet enabled by default)

==================================
 KNOWN ISSUES WE'RE WORKING ON ASAP
==================================

1. Windows may display "unknown publisher" warnings (code signing certificates will be included in the next build) *
2. This build may not be backwards compatible with older versions *
   - If you encounter issues, you may need to Reset Settings (located at the bottom of the Settings screen)
3. Some UI messages may briefly display missing internationalization (i18n) strings *
4. Extended delay during block syncing and P2Pool operations (being addressed by the base layer contributors). Takes 3-5 minutes to sync. *
5. P2Pool is disabled by default until stabilized
6. Block win success animation sometimes does not play *
7. Older versions of Mac (pre Sonoma) may not display animations correctly
8. Anti-Virus protection may erroneously flag some components--it is safe to Allow them (working on versions that don't trigger these alarms)

* = fixed in tomorrow's build

==================================
         DOWNLOAD LINKS
==================================

Message: ==================================
     TARI UNIVERSE v0.2.10
==================================

Freshh build! This build should auto update if you close and re-open (next build won't require you to do that). (Some of you have already done this!)

INSTALLERS:

Windows: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_x64_en-US.msi
Mac: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_universal.dmg

==================================
         WHAT'S NEW
==================================

1. Auto update should update the app (have to close and open it--next build will prompt you without needing to close the app)
2. Code-signed packages for Windows
3. Fixed the block success animation
4. Startup sync improvements, shorter/more informative
5. Round 2 of Settings UI improvements
6. Tower shadows track local sun position (to surprise and delight)
7. No-click mining
8. p2pool improvements behind the scenes
9. Telemetry bug fixes

==================================
        KNOWN ISSUES
==================================

1. p2pool still stabilizing (off by default, in Settings)
2. Some sun positions expose weird graphical artifacts in the tower animation
3. Your mileage on Linux may vary at the moment (and does not support auto update)
4. Older (than Sonoma) Mac OSes exhibit issues with animations

NEXT BUILD IS TOMORROW!

Message: thank you for the feedback! re point 1, our attitude is this: every click a user makes is a miracle. Reducing clicks is always the way to make things easy. If you are opening the software, your intent is to mine, so lets just get right to it and save you the time

re 2: yes we should be able to add this in the settings. @possumously @stringhandler 

re 3: yes this should already be in the settings otherwise we can def add it. Agree with you

re 4: so there is a trade off with the graphics. The intent of this product is accessibility and creating an emotional connection for folks with Tari, which we hope the graphics help us achieve. It is definitely NOT the MOST optimized way to mine. Thats where the command line tools come in. We've debated the idea of including a version that allows you to turn off the graphics and what we settled on is this: when you minimize it, the graphics turn off and you get max performance. When its on your screen, the graphics are on and you get a small performance penalty (Replying to: Few things i personally don't like / would like to see change:

Message: just a heads up on how tomorrow is going to go. We are going to invite the top 1000 folks off the waitlist. Everyone is also going to be given 5 VIP codes to invite friends. Those codes will get them guaranteed access to Batch #2. 

Our goal for Batch #2 is to have Tari Airdrop game support added. In other words.. we are launching an incentivized testnet. You will earn (a fuck ton) of Airdrop game Gems by mining the Tari testnet. You will earn even more by inviting friends

1. Windows may display "unknown publisher" warnings (code signing certificates will be included in the next build) *
2. This build may not be backwards compatible with older versions *
   - If you encounter issues, you may need to Reset Settings (located at the bottom of the Settings screen)
3. Some UI messages may briefly display missing internationalization (i18n) strings *
4. Extended delay during block syncing and P2Pool operations (being addressed by the base layer contributors). Takes 3-5 minutes to sync. *
5. P2Pool is disabled by default until stabilized
6. Block win success animation sometimes does not play *
7. Older versions of Mac (pre Sonoma) may not display animations correctly
8. Anti-Virus protection may erroneously flag some components--it is safe to Allow them (working on versions that don't trigger these alarms)

* = fixed in tomorrow's build

     TARI UNIVERSE v0.2.10
==================================

Freshh build! This build should auto update if you close and re-open (next build won't require you to do that). (Some of you have already done this!)

INSTALLERS:

Windows: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_x64_en-US.msi
Mac: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_universal.dmg

==================================
         WHAT'S NEW
==================================

1. Auto update should update the app (have to close and open it--next build will prompt you without needing to close the app)
2. Code-signed packages for Windows
3. Fixed the block success animation
4. Startup sync improvements, shorter/more informative
5. Round 2 of Settings UI improvements
6. Tower shadows track local sun position (to surprise and delight)
7. No-click mining
8. p2pool improvements behind the scenes
9. Telemetry bug fixes

==================================
        KNOWN ISSUES
==================================

1. p2pool still stabilizing (off by default, in Settings)
2. Some sun positions expose weird graphical artifacts in the tower animation
3. Your mileage on Linux may vary at the moment (and does not support auto update)
4. Older (than Sonoma) Mac OSes exhibit issues with animations

NEXT BUILD IS TOMORROW!)

Message: 🚀 Tari Universe V0.3.3 Release Note 🚀

Today's release is rolling out now via autoupdate. It fixes a few bugs and adds some new animation touches, and continues getting pool mining ready.

For those new to the project, here is a reminder:

## What is Tari Universe? 🌌

Tari Universe is the world's first no-clicks-required desktop mining app. It's designed for everyone to earn Tari by contributing hash power to the Tari network, claiming their stake in a new internet of digital freedom and possibility. 💪

## Key Features 🔑

- ⚡ Instant Mining: Start mining testnet immediately with zero setup required
- 🎨 Visual Experience: Stunning visualizations of your network contribution
- 🔧 Flexible Resource Usage: Choose between Ludicrous mode (dedicated) or Eco mode (background) for CPU/GPU utilization

## What's Next? 🔮

We're continuously improving Tari Universe. In the coming weeks, expect regular updates with bug fixes and new features as we prepare for mainnet. Stay tuned for pool mining, which will democratize blockchain mining by allowing all computers to earn Tari through combined hash power and split rewards. 🤝

Join us in shaping the future of digital freedom. Welcome to the Tari Universe! 🌟

You've given us incredible feedback and we are working hard to make updates. The next few weeks will be big for Tari Universe:

next week - we hope to ship a more stable version of p2pool. This means you will earn tXTM rewards more frequently as you will be automatically connected to a decentralized pool! 

9/24 - we are planning on shipping an update that will connect Tari Universe to the Tari Airdrop Game. This means you will be able to earn Airdrop gems by mining and referring friends to Tari Universe! ALPHA: The # of Gems you will be able to earn will be HUGE!

Few question: are the tokens we mine until this connection happens being counted retroactively? As in should we just keep it all running.
Also: if we own multiple machines running nodes, will we be flagged as cybil for linking different wallets to one airdrop account? Or can all the miners point towards one wallet in the future?

Basically I want to support the network with all the machines I have lying around, but don’t want to be DQd because sybil with multiple wallets lol (Replying to: I want to give a huge shoutout to everyone here.

Message: Great question! No, tXTM has no value and no connection to mainnet tokens. This is really just for testing the software, and getting feedback from the community as we move closer towards mainnet.

That being said, starting on 9/24, we will feature on Tari Universe where you can earn Tari Airdrop Game gems through mining and via invites. At this point in time we dont expect there being any limits to how many computers etc. you run this on as the goal is to simulate a real-world mining like experience with Airdrop Gems pre mainnet launch. We will have more details on exactly how this will all work on 9/24 (assuming we dont run into any showstopper bugs of course!)

The new animation (seems a bit fast with the cube movement) in the pause mining, maybe an emoji here and there can be added to some of the rings besides the cube

As there are similar rings on the wallet balance area, will we see some animation added there?

Looks so clean. Still wondering if and how Tari Universe could play into a rainmeter app integration

If you are trying to make it a friendly experience, you may want to add a simple install mode that most will use. Then offer an advanced install mode where you can flag one client as the proxy node, then cluster the clients against the node.

When you're solo mining, it's just you trying to guess this number on your own. The thing is, there are many other miners out there, often in large groups called "mining pools," all trying to guess the same number at the same time.
Here's why you might not be seeing rewards:

It's really competitive: There are a lot of miners out there, many with very powerful computers dedicated to mining.
It's chance-based: Finding the right "number" (solving the block) is partly luck. Even if you have good equipment, you might not get lucky for a long time.

Mining difficulty: As more people mine, it gets harder to find the right solution. This is designed to keep the rate of new coins steady.

Your mining power: If you're using a regular computer or even a few specialized mining machines, your chances are still pretty slim compared to large mining operations.

Time between rewards: With solo mining, you only get a reward if you solve the block first. This can take a very long time - maybe even years - depending on your mining power and luck.

It's a bit like fishing in a huge ocean. Mining pools are like big fishing boats with huge nets, while solo mining is more like fishing with a single rod. You might catch a big fish (solve a block) eventually, but it could take a very long time.
Many miners join pools to get smaller, but more consistent rewards. In a pool, you team up with other miners and share the rewards when anyone in the group solves a block. (Replying to: Hi all, i'm happy to be part of this journey. Just a question (for now). I've been mining for an hour and my est tXTM/day shows around 15k, but my wallet balance still shows 0. How are rewards distributed? Hourly? Daily? Is it normal my balance is still at 0? I know i haven't been mining for long, but was wondering why it still hasn't moved one bit.Thanks in advance for any reply)

User: possumously | Date: 2024-09-18 19:20:18
Message: from @stringhandler : if you copy the wallet_config.json to each machine, then they will mine to the same address, but they will not have the correct seedwords. So I would recommend: 
1. Choose a master machine. 
2. Write down the seed words.
3. Restore those seeds to aurora
4a. Reset all non-master machines
4b. Do not start TU until you have done 5
5. Copy the wallet_config.json from that machine over the other machines
6. Start TU on non-masters

 the master machine will have the correct seed words, others will be junk. we'll add FAQs on this. (Replying to: Is there any docs on how to change the tari wallet address?

Message: Nice! Was curious about this. I know in the first AMA it was hinted it would be an option in the UI. Better to just do this in the meanwhile? (Replying to: from @stringhandler : if you copy the wallet_config.json to each machine, then they will mine to the same address, but they will not have the correct seedwords. So I would recommend: 
1. Choose a master machine. 
2. Write down the seed words.
3. Restore those seeds to aurora
4a. Reset all non-master machines
4b. Do not start TU until you have done 5
5. Copy the wallet_config.json from that machine over the other machines
6. Start TU on non-masters

 the master machine will have the correct seed words, others will be junk. we'll add FAQs on this.)

Message: I understand and greatly appreciate your POV, and of course efficiency matters. Even in the case of Universe we are putting a lot of effort into optimizing the graphics to use as little GPU as possible (the graphics only impact GPU). Furthermore, and this is super important: the graphics stuff turns off completely when Universe is minimized. The idea here is that we want folks who care about extracting every iota of efficiency from their setup to also feel good about running Universe!

I installed the deb, then ran `tari-universe`, and got this error: `symbol lookup error: /snap/core20/current/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0: undefined symbol: __libc_pthread_init, version GLIBC_PRIVATE`

When I run `cargo tauri dev`, I get the same error.

Message: I have good news, but I'm not sure if this is a secure solution, so it's not a recommendation. Hopefully the Tari contributors can look into the security.

After installing the alternate fuse library mentioned in the link above, I could run the AppImage for Tari Universe, and there were no adverse affects on my system. I was able to reboot and restart Universe just fine. 🥳

sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt install libfuse2
chmod +x ./tari-universe_0.3.7_amd64.AppImage
sudo ./tari-universe_0.3.7_amd64.AppImage

The console output keeps showing "Failed to get NVML", which is probably the NVIDIA Management Library, but I don't have a GPU. It just keeps outputting that error, even when GPU Mining is toggled off. It doesn't seem to be an issue, but is probably using some CPU resources that I desperately need for mining. :)

Message: Last update for the night: After Universe is running on Ubuntu for 10 mins or so, the `CPU Power` and `Est tXTM/day` fields show a spinner animation. At the same time, the console constantly repeats this message: `WARN Failed to get xmrig summary: error sending request for url (http://127.0.0.1:9090/2/summary)`

4 seconds before those warning started, the console showed this:
`INFO Selected version: 6.22.0`
`INFO Killing previous instances of xmrig`

So, I imagine that those fields come from the xmrig summary, and after the xmrig process was stopped, it appears that it was not restarted. That may also explain why my macbook has not mined a block since updating to Universe v0.3.7.

However, `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 9090` outputs:
`tcp 0 0 127.0 0.1:9090 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 9810/xmrig`

Meaning the xmrig process is running even when Universe can't get the summary. So it may be an authorization issue when calling the endpoint, which occurs after starting a new instance.

Message: Update: No blocks mined on Ubuntu w/ AMD Ryzen 9 7950X running Universe (as sudo), which typically mines at least 1 block per hour using Suite. The "Failed to get xmrig summary" error continues to repeat." Hashrate shows 18.5k for Universe, but was 21k for Suite for the 15 min ave.

I restarted without sudo this morning, and after 10 minutes, started getting the same console error repeatedly, and the same fields had spinners.

I also noticed that when running as sudo, I could not access the seed words, but when running without sudo, I could. (I understand they are separate wallets due to separate user folders/configs.)

Also, my Macbook Air running Universe, which mined over 300k in blocks before v0.3.7, has only a small mining reward from yesterday, and the `CPU Power` and `Est tXTM/day` fields show a spinner animation, same as Ubuntu. Meanwhile, my second Macbook Air, running Suite, mined 3 blocks overnight. I restarted Universe and will continue monitoring. (The fields have values again after restarting.)

The toolbar icon on the Macbook Air did not open the popup menu with hashrate, etc. (Worked fined on Ubuntu.)

Although, we have some expected bugs in a v0 product, overall I have positive sentiments because the software is easy to install and running without any system issues. Looks like some application logic is all that's needed to reach the finish line. 🏁 (Replying to: Last update for the night: After Universe is running on Ubuntu for 10 mins or so, the `CPU Power` and `Est tXTM/day` fields show a spinner animation.

Message: There does seem to be an important feature missing in Universe unless I'm just missing something obvious. Is there any way to see the transaction history, or do I need to copy the seed words and restore the wallet with the console wallet to see history?

I looked at my transactions with the console wallet and can see my P2Pool reward from yesterday (v0.3.7). That amount of Tari is in stark contrast though to the mining rewards received in previous days with earlier versions of Universe, and more so to the mining rewards received by Suite. So hopefully, this is just a temporary issue that will get resolved before mainnet.

Message: Out of curiosity, was the Tari team doing node maintenance last night? The mobile app didnt show any mining rewards. Went into the connection antennae icon, and noticed it wasn't connected to a node. I was on node five, and checked all of them, then node number one was active, and all of the queued mining rewards flowed in. I was going to write up an issue considering the issues with the difficulties of having a ui/ux friendly client, and working around the async callbacks and wait. I see some of the complexity in the client, I am impressed, seriously.

Message: I chose the MSI GTX 1660 Super Gaming over the MSI RTX 3060 Ti because it’s a better fit for my plan to run at 30% ECO mode and 50% balanced mode. While the RTX 3060 Ti excels at 100% load, it requires significantly more power. At 30%, the 3060 Ti results in a $176.25 loss over 5 years, while the GTX 1660 Super limits that loss to $12.38. At 50%, the 1660 Super turns a $375.25 profit, compared to just $6.64 for the 3060 Ti.

Ultimately, the GTX 1660 Super provides a better balance of profitability and efficiency at lower loads, making it the smarter choice for my needs.

I don't know if the xmrig error is related to the Universe prompt though. These might be separate issues.
However, if I can't run xmrig, my guess is that Universe can't mine since it needs to run xmrig.

Message: I am going to stop all of my miners for a while. Pretty sure I have been hitting blocks too often, which is probably a crappy experience for others. On a side note, you may want to create some block animation logic to stop the swastikas. They appear about every two hours or so. I have a monitor with all of the miners showing the animation, so I glance at them often. I just saw a swastika hit a block with the gold animation.

For optimal performance, ensure you have enough free RAM (at least 2.5GB for CPU mining) and consider running Tari Universe as administrator on Windows.

Eco mode is designed for background mining with lower resource usage, allowing you to mine while using your computer for other tasks. Ludicrous mode is for dedicated mining with higher resource usage, maximizing your mining performance. You can choose between these modes in the settings.

Message: @sparkslice Hi, I joined waitlist through my android fone and got access to download the app today. As it was to be done on a desktop so I turned to my laptop. When I went to tari's website I entered my email and name as there was no other option for a login. Received a link on email. It took me to the site again and it is now showing me as a new joiner with 250563 number on the waitlist. This is so disappointing as I waited for almost two month.

Message: so the way proof of work mining works is that you are contributing compute power to help secure the network. Think of it like a competition. You are competing with everyone else mining to win blocks. When we upgrade p2pool this coming week, more people will win, more often because everyone will be a part of a pool. A pool is like a co-op. Everyone is working together to mine and you will receive a pro-rata portion of the reward based on teh computational power you contribute (Replying to: Will this lost time be counted 😅)

Message: With most software the SDLC (software development lifecycle) uses ci/cd  (continuous development, and continuous improvement). From the commits, they are powering through blockers to be able to incentivize testnet mining. If I had a vote, I'd have them fix the plumbing and foundation, before painting the house. :)

Also the blue blocks are no longer appearing in the visual.

Another thing I noticed is that the console wallet shows 2 mining rewards since v0.4.6 started, but they are entire blocks, so I'm not sure if p2pool is working right. (Replying to: I installed 0.4.6 and it started up fine and it's showing my last wallet balance.

User: sparkslice | Date: 2024-10-01 01:21:24
Message: great question! So you cant easily have the same wallet across different Universe installations rn. That is a feature that will come in the future. For the incentized testnet, you just need a X account and to authenticate with the same X account across all installs of Universe to receive aggregate credit (Replying to: How to have multiple computers running for the same wallet?)

User: uforiaio | Date: 2024-10-01 01:21:26
Message: Look for wallet_config.json, which on Windows is in appdata/roaming/nextnet/ if I recall. Copy that, and shutdown your other clients. Replace the file on all machines, and it will work. 

There are some issues with it though, Once you hit the fourth machine the Universe clients may not show a balance or rollbacks. I think that's do to the increase in GH/s. (Replying to: How to have multiple computers running for the same wallet?)

The interesting thing is eco mode on the laptops will use 80% cpu and gpu.

I set the power settings to high performance in a room that is 70f (21c) with adequate airflow. I even put a small fan pointed at the ingress point of the laptops for airflow. Even with all of that the GPU's were reaching 75-80c and going into thermal protect. The i9 CPU's were around the same.

Message: This morning I logged into the host that I re-used the wallet_conf.json. The machine didn't have internet access and it as slow. I checked connections with netstat -aon or a variant. I noticed the device had hit port exhaustion. I uninstalled all clients and didn't re-use the same wallet_conf.json file. 

The peer connections are still there as expected, so I have a theory on why I was getting throttled/banned. It seems like all six of the devices were flooding updates that triggered a suppression event, which I believe is tied to using the same json file. It's still a working theory, but the behavior of the clients aren't causing port exhaustion now.

If this happened on my machine, I can only imagine what the Tor destination was viewing from my connections, which would have had the same wallet ID. Not sure of the nomenclature from a Tor basis, but since I am familiar with routing/switching, it tracks.

User: sparkslice | Date: 2024-10-02 17:59:06
Message: here is a blurb for you on what Tari is all about 🙂

Tari is a new layer 1 blockchain protocol with a profound approach to building a massive on-chain user base. 

Building a thriving, loyal, on-chain user base is one of the most challenging things to do in our industry. Existing protocols struggle with this because airdropped tokens predominantly end up in the hands of farmers and Sybils. Their on-chain user bases evaporate rapidly as the farmers and Sybils sell their allocations and move on to the next airdrop. Their only alternative is to route users through high friction and low conversion rate onramps. As a result, most blockchain protocols have few loyal on-chain users. 

The challenge for existing protocols continues beyond building an ardent on-chain user base. When protocol teams attempt to recruit developers to build on their protocol, they face a catch-22: the best developers want to create applications on platforms with many users, but users demand great applications that keep their attention. The result is a wasteland of protocols with few users, limited apps, and minimal chance of success.

Tari is the ultimate solution to this multifactorial problem. Tari is proof of work and uses an ASIC-resistant hashing algorithm. Anyone can download and run the Tari miner to mine Tari on their laptop or desktop. There is no complicated, multi-step onboarding process required. It is easier to become a native Tari user than it is to become a native user for any other blockchain protocol.

For developers, Tari introduces a revolutionary approach to app distribution. The Tari miner will have a built-in application launcher. Everyone who mines Tari will have instant access to every Tari application through an interface that looks and feels like an app store. With Tari's unique dual-layer system, developers get the distribution benefit and security of a Rust-based proof of work L1 with the scalability, fast finality, and low fees of a high-performance, native L2. The result is magical: a high-performance, low-fee blockchain protocol that will rapidly scale its on-chain user base to millions and enable developers to reach all of them.

Message: /faq How does mining work on the Tari Network? 
--------------------------------------------------
User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2024-10-02 18:39:49
Message: Tari uses a hybrid Proof of Work system, which makes use of both RandomX and SHA3 algorithms. 50% of blocks are mined using RandomX and 50% of blocks are mined using SHA3. The network mines 720 blocks per day, with each block taking an average of about 2 minutes to mine. Tari Universe supports both CPU and GPU mining, and you can choose between Eco mode for background mining and Ludicrous mode for dedicated mining. P2pool mining is enabled by default, allowing miners to combine their hashpower and share rewards more frequently. (Replying to: /faq How does mining work on the Tari Network?)

--------------------------------------------------
User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2024-10-02 18:40:57
Message: To increase your hashrate, you can try the following: 1. Ensure you have enough free RAM (at least 2.5GB for CPU mining). 2. Close any other applications running to free up system resources. 3. For CPU mining on Windows, running Tari Universe as administrator can provide a boost. 4. Consider using both CPU and GPU for mining if your hardware supports it. 5. Make sure your Tari Universe application is up to date for any performance improvements.

Message: Tari tokens can be used within the Tari ecosystem, such as in the Tari Store where users can get exclusive collectibles using their tXTM. However, please note that tXTM is a testnet token and has no real value. For more specific uses, you might want to check the latest updates from the Tari team.

Message: so testnet Tari is valueless, which is the tXTM
but the gems will have some value right? (Replying to: gm fam, tomorrow is the day where you will start to earn Tari Airdrop Game gems when mining with Tari Universe. More details to follow, but our goal is to reward the early Tari miner community on 2 fronts:

1. Mining on testnet (and therefore helping us test Tari L1 at scale)
2. Inviting friends to install Tari Universe and mine

Furthermore, the testnet Tari you earn, while valueless, can be used to acquire collectible items in the TTL store. There will be a new TTL store drop in the coming weeks with a bunch of very cool items to celebrate the final Tari testnet. Thank you for being on this journey with us. We cannot wait for you to start earning gems through mining with Tari Universe! 💜🐢)

Message: Thank you for being a part of the Tari community! Here is a little intro to Tari if you are brand new and arent sure what it is yet:

Tari is a new layer 1 blockchain protocol with a profound approach to building a massive on-chain user base. 

Building a thriving, loyal, on-chain user base is one of the most challenging things to do in our industry. Existing protocols struggle with this because airdropped tokens predominantly end up in the hands of farmers and Sybils. Their on-chain user bases evaporate rapidly as the farmers and Sybils sell their allocations and move on to the next airdrop. Their only alternative is to route users through high friction and low conversion rate onramps. As a result, most blockchain protocols have few loyal on-chain users. 

The challenge for existing protocols continues beyond building an ardent on-chain user base. When protocol teams attempt to recruit developers to build on their protocol, they face a catch-22: the best developers want to create applications on platforms with many users, but users demand great applications that keep their attention. The result is a wasteland of protocols with few users, limited apps, and minimal chance of success.

Tari is the ultimate solution to this multifactorial problem. Tari is proof of work and uses an ASIC-resistant hashing algorithm. Anyone can download and run the Tari miner to mine Tari on their laptop or desktop. There is no complicated, multi-step onboarding process required. It is easier to become a native Tari user than it is to become a native user for any other blockchain protocol.

For developers, Tari introduces a revolutionary approach to app distribution. The Tari miner will have a built-in application launcher. Everyone who mines Tari will have instant access to every Tari application through an interface that looks and feels like an app store. With Tari's unique dual-layer system, developers get the distribution benefit and security of a Rust-based proof of work L1 with the scalability, fast finality, and low fees of a high-performance, native L2. The result is magical: a high-performance, low-fee blockchain protocol that will rapidly scale its on-chain user base to millions and enable developers to reach all of them.

User: sparkslice | Date: 2024-10-03 02:51:32
Message: so there is a way to do this but its a bit complicated rn. Best thing to do is not worry about your tXTM balance because testnet tokens have no value, and focus on gems. You can connect to your X account from an unlimited number of Tari Universe installs and therefore aggregate all your gems (Replying to: i initially install the Tari App on my smaller PC that doesn't have GPU now i want to install Tari on my PC with a good GPU how can I transfer my account in such a way that i'll be able to retain my earn tXTM?)

The chosen music needs to be not too simple and not too complex; familiarity will dull your senses. It needs to be non-verbal

Instrumentals and/or dance music can aid in this department. Learn how to deploy music as a tool to enhance your productivity

Message: yes sorry about that. This is tied to the fact that Tari Universe comes bundled with XMRig which is the Monero miner. Unfort its flagged by most AV products. We do have an update coming for Universe in the next week or 2 that should fix this problem (we hope) (Replying to: What's up guys?  After installing the Tari miner I keep getting the following from the Antivirus program.  Is this normal and is it safe to try to exclude it from the anti-virus scan?)
--------------------------------------------------
User: sparkslice | Date: 2024-10-03 03:50:16
Message: XMRig is safe and virus free so you should have no issues here. Its flagging it bcause its a miner, not because it contains a virus or trojan

Message: If anyone is showing not connected to Tari, I would set your miners to ECO, then wait for an update from the Tari team. They are working on it. 

I have mine set to ECO now as well. I've relaunched a couple of times and it seems the back-end is having some issues with the increased client counts. 

I'm just a power-user that has been helping out by opening up issues while Tari launches, so I don't speak for Tari. 

If you are connected, don't do anything. If you aren't connected, every once and a while relaunch Tari and see if your client is able to connect to the Tari network.

我现在也把我的矿机设置为ECO模式了。我重新启动了几次，看起来后端在处理大量客户端时遇到了一些问题。

我是一个资深用户，Tari启动时我通过提出问题提供了一些帮助，所以我并不代表Tari发言。

如果你已连接，就不需要做任何操作。如果你未连接，偶尔重新启动Tari，看看你的客户端是否能够连接到Tari网络。

Message: The Tari team is currently addressing several issues. Everything seen in chat today has already been reported.

Remember, this is an incentivized testnet, and you're among the first 1,000 participants in a project that will scale to 250,000+ users. Bugs are expected, and we’re here to help find and fix them. The testnet is incentivized to reward users for identifying these bugs while Tari scales.

If you launch the client and encounter issues, switch to ECO mode or stop mining until the Tari team provides an update. If the client is running, a push notification will inform you when an update is available, and the client will show it.

If you encounter any new issues, feel free to report them. You can also ask the bot for assistance with commands like /faqqer VC++.

**Common Issues:**

**Missing Files on Windows:**

If you receive an error about a missing file, your Windows installation is likely missing the Visual C++ Redistributable. You can download it here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist. Future releases will include it, as it's usually part of Windows. (Or use /faqqer VC++ in Telegram.)

**Client Can’t Connect to Tari Network:**

Go to Settings -> Experimental. If it shows “Not connected to the Tari Network,” set the client to ECO mode until an update is provided. If you are connected, no action is needed. The issue has been reported, so you’re not alone.

**Client Missing Files or Not Working:**

Check if your antivirus is blocking it. Many users have had to add the Tari folder as an exception.

**Block Animations Stuck:**

This is purely visual, similar to a screensaver. If it’s not working, you can turn it off by going to Settings -> Experimental and disabling the visuals slider.

**Spinning Wheels in the User Interface while Tari is Mining:**

This is a known bug, but it does not affect mining.

**Spinning Wheels in the User Interface while Tari is Not Mining:**

Again, check your antivirus to ensure it's not blocking the client. Many users have resolved this by adding an exception for the Tari folder.

**Pool Mining (Everyone is pool mining, no one is not)**

The client is hardcoded to pool mine. The stats may not be accurate, its a bug and has been reported. 

**I'm just a power user helping the Tari community by reporting issues, so the Tari team can focus on fixing them.**

Message: It's Tor, I would use OnionBalance or one of the handful of other packages. A master server won't scale to hundreds of thousands connections. Ignoring port exhaustion, resource contention, and single points of failure. I'd lean into a distributed load-balanced front-end with an auto-scaling back-end.

Note: port exhaustion is more tied to maximum number of file descriptors for a tcp socket. /* been a while having to even think about this one after the cloud era began.
