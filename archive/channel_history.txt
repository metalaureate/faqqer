𝙍𝙖𝙝𝙪𝙡, [Sep 28, 2024 at 9:43:09 AM]:
Ok


I have a basic pc with basic graphics card, i am mining from 10 hr, how is this result ?


Simon Hill, [Sep 28, 2024 at 9:46:16 AM]:
It’s good! And it will improve over time as we roll out updates to the pooling algorithm. Right now you are in a pool with lots of people sharing the rewards between you.


Can’t say what it will all be worth —anything from covering your electric bill to boat drinks.


𝙍𝙖𝙝𝙪𝙡, [Sep 28, 2024 at 9:48:03 AM]:
Ok


If I stop mining, and shutdown my pc, tomarrow when i turn back on, these tokens will gone or there are visible here


Simon Hill, [Sep 28, 2024 at 9:50:26 AM]:
They remain forever on the blockchain (although this is testnet).


Your balance will show up


Only if you install on a fresh machine will it create a new wallet with a zero balance.


But your old wallet will always exist


𝙍𝙖𝙝𝙪𝙡, [Sep 28, 2024 at 9:52:08 AM]:
Ok


Is there any use of these tXTM


Simon Hill, [Sep 28, 2024 at 10:03:22 AM]:
Not yet. You’re helping test. But next week we will integrate the airdrop.tari.com and you will be awarded gems for mining and such, which will translate into XTM at mainnet.

Message: Tari Universe supports both CPU and GPU mining. You can choose to use one or both in the settings. The choice between CPU and GPU mining depends on your hardware and personal preference. For optimal performance, ensure you have enough free RAM (at least 2.5GB for CPU mining) and consider running Tari Universe as administrator on Windows. (Replying to: /faqqer what is the best way to mine with Tari Universe? CPU or GPU?)

Message: so the way proof of work mining works is that you are contributing compute power to help secure the network. Think of it like a competition. You are competing with everyone else mining to win blocks. When we upgrade p2pool this coming week, more people will win, more often because everyone will be a part of a pool. A pool is like a co-op. Everyone is working together to mine and you will receive a pro-rata portion of the reward based on teh computational power you contribute (Replying to: Will this lost time be counted 😅)
