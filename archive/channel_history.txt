A quick update re Gem counts and why some of you are seeing your Gem balances decline: A configuration error during the last network reset caused gems from the previous reset to be double-counted at the same block height. This has now been fixed, but resulted in subtractions.

Additionally, to combat invite farming, we removed all gems earned from invites where the referee hadn‚Äôt mined for more than 6 hours. Tari is for humans, not sybils, bots or farmers. We will continue to evolve our strategy to reduce sybils, bots, and farmers in the coming weeks and months.

Message: Re: Glytex (GPU MINER) changes

We had some optimizations merged that saw a 6% overall perf increase, which we think is resulting in peoples machines seeing higher usage on previously used settings. There's a lot to explore regarding custom settings and the wide variation of cards. So it's something we'll be revisiting for sure.

Regarding detection we'll also be looking into it. No changes were made regarding detection so it's an unexpected change to hear so many people are running into it. We will also be investigating this of course.

Message: Hello, Tari team and community.

I‚Äôve recently installed Tari Universe and have been mining for about 30 hours using three older laptops. So far, I‚Äôve accumulated 16,099 Gems.

To be honest, I don‚Äôt have any prior experience in mining or crypto projects like this, so I‚Äôm still figuring things out as I go. I‚Äôd really appreciate it if anyone could point me toward some beginner-friendly resources or reading materials‚Äîespecially anything that explains the bigger picture behind Tari, its goals, and what‚Äôs happening before/after the Universe test phase.

Thanks in advance, and looking forward to learning more.

Message: welcome to the Tari community! im sure others will share materials with you soon, but Tari is a very unique L1 that is focused on 3 core principles:

1. Accessibility and ease of use - As you've seen for yourself, installing Tari Universe and starting to mine is incredibly easy to do. Tari uses an ASIC resistant hashing algorithm for 50% of blocks so that folks can mine on most modern Macs or PCs
2. Confidentiality - Tari is default confidential. Our goal is to keep Tari users safe by ensuring their financial activities are kept confidential by default. After all, no one wants their financial history exposed to the world. And no business can afford for their financial information to be a matter of public record. 
3. Creating the best developer experience in the world - we aim to make Tari the best developer platform in the world by giving developers what they want more then anything else: native distribution. We aim to do this by building an app launcher natively into Tari Universe in the future so that every Tari Universe user can access the world of Tari apps at their finger tips, and devs can get massive distribution.

Tari is pro freedom and pro human. Its been in development for over 7 years. Its primarily built in Rust (Replying to: Hello, Tari team and community.
