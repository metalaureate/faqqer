You are helping us beta test Tari Universe and make it better, which is appreciated and is certainly not a waste.

You've given us incredible feedback and we are working hard to make updates. The next few weeks will be big for Tari Universe:

next week - we hope to ship a more stable version of p2pool. This means you will earn tXTM rewards more frequently as you will be automatically connected to a decentralized pool! 

9/24 - we are planning on shipping an update that will connect Tari Universe to the Tari Airdrop Game. This means you will be able to earn Airdrop gems by mining and referring friends to Tari Universe! ALPHA: The # of Gems you will be able to earn will be HUGE!

Few question: are the tokens we mine until this connection happens being counted retroactively? As in should we just keep it all running.
Also: if we own multiple machines running nodes, will we be flagged as cybil for linking different wallets to one airdrop account? Or can all the miners point towards one wallet in the future?

Message: Great question! No, tXTM has no value and no connection to mainnet tokens. This is really just for testing the software, and getting feedback from the community as we move closer towards mainnet.

That being said, starting on 9/24, we will feature on Tari Universe where you can earn Tari Airdrop Game gems through mining and via invites. At this point in time we dont expect there being any limits to how many computers etc. you run this on as the goal is to simulate a real-world mining like experience with Airdrop Gems pre mainnet launch. We will have more details on exactly how this will all work on 9/24 (assuming we dont run into any showstopper bugs of course!)

The new animation (seems a bit fast with the cube movement) in the pause mining, maybe an emoji here and there can be added to some of the rings besides the cube

As there are similar rings on the wallet balance area, will we see some animation added there?

Message: Hey hey, mine still crashes when opening so can’t update to 3.3 (Replying to: 🚀 Tari Universe V0.3.3 Release Note 🚀

Today's release is rolling out now via autoupdate. It fixes a few bugs and adds some new animation touches, and continues getting pool mining ready.

For those new to the project, here is a reminder:

## What is Tari Universe? 🌌

Tari Universe is the world's first no-clicks-required desktop mining app. It's designed for everyone to earn Tari by contributing hash power to the Tari network, claiming their stake in a new internet of digital freedom and possibility. 💪

## Key Features 🔑

- ⚡ Instant Mining: Start mining testnet immediately with zero setup required
- 🎨 Visual Experience: Stunning visualizations of your network contribution
- 🔧 Flexible Resource Usage: Choose between Ludicrous mode (dedicated) or Eco mode (background) for CPU/GPU utilization

## What's Next? 🔮

We're continuously improving Tari Universe. In the coming weeks, expect regular updates with bug fixes and new features as we prepare for mainnet. Stay tuned for pool mining, which will democratize blockchain mining by allowing all computers to earn Tari through combined hash power and split rewards. 🤝

Join us in shaping the future of digital freedom. Welcome to the Tari Universe! 🌟)

Message: Hi jake question: why wouldnt you want to use gpu for mining? (Replying to: Just updated my miner to 3.3, 

The settings saved from previous, so that’s amazing. Confident it won’t just turn on my GPU to mine again

The new animation (seems a bit fast with the cube movement) in the pause mining, maybe an emoji here and there can be added to some of the rings besides the cube

As there are similar rings on the wallet balance area, will we see some animation added there?

Looks so clean. Still wondering if and how Tari Universe could play into a rainmeter app integration)

Message: Anyone else run into a Universe client that is not active, but still showing the visual? I noticed the gpu was at 5% and didnt have any luck overnight. 

There should be a means to view if the client is connected to Tor,  proxy, node, etc. Some people will not notice the 5% gpu and let it run for days since the animation shows it is working.
