Message: Tari miners receive XTM for every block they mine, with block rewards declining on a block-by-block basis. In the first 12 years post-mainnet launch, the Tari emission curve dictates the mining reward. After 12 years, the protocol rewards miners via a tail emission to ensure they receive compensation forever for securing the network. The tail emission increases the XTM emitted by **1%** a year. Tari miners receive **100%** of block rewards and Layer 1 transaction fees.

It's minotari_node ( with grpc-enabled and mining-enabled )
It's minotari_console_wallet ( so you can see your TARI address )
It's minotari_merge_mining_proxy ( it will ask you for your TARI address )

After setting those up just run xmrig pointing to the mm_proxy localhost:18801 like this:
xmrig -o localhost:18081 -u YOUR_MORENO_ADDRESS -k --daemon (Replying to: if i wanted to only using CPU (tari randomx and randomx merged mining) with the tari cli, 1. which binaries should i be running, besides minotari_node.

Message: Hi all, shoutout to @thepinkpill for sharing this workaround for sync issues on Tari Universe for Windows:

1. Back up your seed phrase <-- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
2. uninstall Tari Universe
3. delete both "com.tari" folders in user name\AppData\Local and user name\AppData\Roaming

note: this will delete the Tari blockchain from your computer and your wallet (please back up your seed phrase before doing this or YOU WILL LOSE YOUR XTM!)

Then reinstall Tari Universe, import your seed phrase and let it resync. Hopefully this helps solve the issue for you. A few other tips thanks to the amazing @xt1085 (and their incredible Tari China community at @cntari) :

4. Change your DNS to 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8. Sometimes, local ISP DNS causes wallet sync failures.
5. Temporarily disable your antivirus software, or add Tari Universe to its whitelist. Some security programs may block wallet network connections.

Contributors are continuing to work on solving these issues in a cleaner fashion and a new update to Tari Universe will be available soon! Thank you for being a Tari OG 💜🐢

In case you need anything from my side, glad to help with what I got to offer for that cuckaroo fork - well at least what I have is a working gpu code across most common archs and some general experience with cuckoo codes overall. 

If you allow one question: is that sha3x part supposed to stay like it is? Because at least in that x-post it still war marketed as gpu pow, but to be honest: its a rather asic friendly algorithm and already now widely mined on fpgas. It won't last long as profitable pow for gpu miners. (Replying to: yes fair point, that was when we were more ambitious with the fork schedule 🙂)

re: SHA3, yes contributors know that this will likely end up in the hands of folks with fPGAs and ASICs in the future. Our view is that this is actually positive because from a network security POV it adds meaningful strength. Contributors believe that creating a 4 lane highway where different levels / types of miners are all able to participate, help secure the network, and be rewarded for their efforts is the ideal outcome (Replying to: :) Well fully understandable.

Message: do you do OpenCL stuff too? (Replying to: :) Well fully understandable. I was responsible for managing two PoW hard forks with Beam (and one with Flux / Zelcash) back then and if I learned one thing its always: better be patient and give things the time it needs, but put that extra time in quality before putting things to the public.
In case you need anything from my side, glad to help with what I got to offer for that cuckaroo fork - well at least what I have is a working gpu code across most common archs and some general experience with cuckoo codes overall. 

If you allow one question: is that sha3x part supposed to stay like it is? Because at least in that x-post it still war marketed as gpu pow, but to be honest: its a rather asic friendly algorithm and already now widely mined on fpgas. It won't last long as profitable pow for gpu miners.)

Message: In this era of decentralization, no individual’s contribution should be overlooked. Whether you are a quiet small miner or a professional with powerful hardware—whether you are dedicated to GPU or CPU mining—there is a place for every form of effort in the Tari ecosystem. I truly appreciate the idealism behind Tari’s “four-lane highway” consensus: a design that values diversity and enables both the strong and the humble to participate, co-create, and share in the future. (Replying to: we'd love to connect with you about this! thank you so much for being here! 

re: SHA3, yes contributors know that this will likely end up in the hands of folks with fPGAs and ASICs in the future. Our view is that this is actually positive because from a network security POV it adds meaningful strength. Contributors believe that creating a 4 lane highway where different levels / types of miners are all able to participate, help secure the network, and be rewarded for their efforts is the ideal outcome)

Message: i've also tried reset the app, deleting all tari data. still NOT working. After some effort, i found because network admin banned `xmrig`, so i have to proxy via shadowsocks on request sent from xmrig process. (Replying to: Hi all, shoutout to @thepinkpill for sharing this workaround for sync issues on Tari Universe for Windows:

1. Back up your seed phrase <-- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
2. uninstall Tari Universe
3. delete both "com.tari" folders in user name\AppData\Local and user name\AppData\Roaming

note: this will delete the Tari blockchain from your computer and your wallet (please back up your seed phrase before doing this or YOU WILL LOSE YOUR XTM!)

Then reinstall Tari Universe, import your seed phrase and let it resync. Hopefully this helps solve the issue for you. A few other tips thanks to the amazing @xt1085 (and their incredible Tari China community at @cntari) :

4. Change your DNS to 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8. Sometimes, local ISP DNS causes wallet sync failures.
5. Temporarily disable your antivirus software, or add Tari Universe to its whitelist. Some security programs may block wallet network connections.

Contributors are continuing to work on solving these issues in a cleaner fashion and a new update to Tari Universe will be available soon! Thank you for being a Tari OG 💜🐢)

Message: Wow, lollidieb is on board) if the crew uses your knowledge, the cuckoo will be super effective. (Replying to: :) Well fully understandable. I was responsible for managing two PoW hard forks with Beam (and one with Flux / Zelcash) back then and if I learned one thing its always: better be patient and give things the time it needs, but put that extra time in quality before putting things to the public.
In case you need anything from my side, glad to help with what I got to offer for that cuckaroo fork - well at least what I have is a working gpu code across most common archs and some general experience with cuckoo codes overall. 

If you allow one question: is that sha3x part supposed to stay like it is? Because at least in that x-post it still war marketed as gpu pow, but to be honest: its a rather asic friendly algorithm and already now widely mined on fpgas. It won't last long as profitable pow for gpu miners.)

Message: *🚀 TARI UNIVERSE v1.2.0: The Flourishing*
🔄 Rolling out via auto-update

Hey everyone,

Welcome to *Tari Universe v1.2.0 - "The Flourishing"!* Contributors are thrilled to deliver powerful new features designed to expand the Tari Universe and create new opportunities for the Tari community:

*🌉 New Features:*
• *Bridge XTM → wXTM NOW* directly on Ethereum Mainnet via Metamask.
• *Swap Ethereum & ETH tokens → wXTM COMING TOMORROW* natively within the Tari Universe (for now, you can buy wXTM on Uniswap!)

These features mark an exciting step towards integrating Tari with broader blockchain ecosystems.

*⚠️ Important Notes:*
• *MVP Release:* Currently a one-way bridge (XTM → wXTM only). The two-way bridge (wXTM → XTM) is scheduled for release around July 2025.
• *Transaction Cap:* Transactions are initially capped at 100,000 XTM for security purposes. Transactions exceeding this amount will fail. There is no limit to the number of transactions you can do. This cap will be increased and eventually removed as the feature matures.
• *Potential Bugs:* Although extensive QA testing has been conducted, given the variety of community system configurations, you may encounter unforeseen issues. Please report bugs you encounter here: https://forms.gle/n8MVwLRrL9m6G7w39 so contributors can help!

*🔖 Official wXTM Contract Address:*
• *Contract Address:* `0xfD36fA88bb3feA8D1264fc89d70723b6a2B56958`
• *Controller:* `0x6c6f5B091bc50a6cB62e55B5c1EB7455205d2880`
• *Bridge:* `0xb72FD42A94a360587dCe790947e18A2CbcD4BC65`

A community-led liquidity pool has been seeded on *Uniswap*, but you are free to use your wXTM tokens with any Ethereum-compatible tool you choose. Future deployments of wXTM across multiple chains will leverage LayerZero OFTs, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers.

*🔍 Smart Contract Audit Report:*
We want to thank the team at Coinspect for auditing the wXTM smart contract. You can view their audit report here: https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tari%20-%20wXTM%20Bridge%20-%20Fix%20Review%20-%20v250528.pdf

*🐞 Known Issues (Fixes Coming Soon):*
• *GPU Mining:* Might require manual restart after sync completion
• *Mac OS Keychain Prompts:* Multiple prompts may appear during wallet updates. Choosing "Always Allow" resolves this issue
• *Translations:* Bridge feature translations are currently missing but will be added ASAP
• *Display/UI Artifacts:* Minor visual design errors present

*📥 Download Now:*

*Thank you for being a Tari OG.* Everyone who mines is a key contributor to Tari. You are securing the network, and because of you, it is alive! It is the honor of a lifetime to contribute to this project with you. Tari exists for one reason: you 💜🐢

🔄 Rolling out via auto-update

Hey everyone,

Welcome to *Tari Universe v1.2.0 - "The Flourishing"!* Contributors are thrilled to deliver powerful new features designed to expand the Tari Universe and create new opportunities for the Tari community:

*🌉 New Features:*
• *Bridge XTM → wXTM NOW* directly on Ethereum Mainnet via Metamask.
• *Swap Ethereum & ETH tokens → wXTM COMING TOMORROW* natively within the Tari Universe (for now, you can buy wXTM on Uniswap!)

These features mark an exciting step towards integrating Tari with broader blockchain ecosystems.

*⚠️ Important Notes:*
• *MVP Release:* Currently a one-way bridge (XTM → wXTM only). The two-way bridge (wXTM → XTM) is scheduled for release around July 2025.
• *Transaction Cap:* Transactions are initially capped at 100,000 XTM for security purposes. Transactions exceeding this amount will fail. There is no limit to the number of transactions you can do. This cap will be increased and eventually removed as the feature matures.
• *Potential Bugs:* Although extensive QA testing has been conducted, given the variety of community system configurations, you may encounter unforeseen issues. Please report bugs you encounter here: https://forms.gle/n8MVwLRrL9m6G7w39 so contributors can help!

*🔖 Official wXTM Contract Address:*
• *Contract Address:* `0xfD36fA88bb3feA8D1264fc89d70723b6a2B56958`
• *Controller:* `0x6c6f5B091bc50a6cB62e55B5c1EB7455205d2880`
• *Bridge:* `0xb72FD42A94a360587dCe790947e18A2CbcD4BC65`

A community-led liquidity pool has been seeded on *Uniswap*, but you are free to use your wXTM tokens with any Ethereum-compatible tool you choose. Future deployments of wXTM across multiple chains will leverage LayerZero OFTs, enabling seamless cross-chain transfers.

*🔍 Smart Contract Audit Report:*
We want to thank the team at Coinspect for auditing the wXTM smart contract. You can view their audit report here: https://www.coinspect.com/doc/Coinspect%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Tari%20-%20wXTM%20Bridge%20-%20Fix%20Review%20-%20v250528.pdf

*🐞 Known Issues (Fixes Coming Soon):*
• *GPU Mining:* Might require manual restart after sync completion
• *Mac OS Keychain Prompts:* Multiple prompts may appear during wallet updates. Choosing "Always Allow" resolves this issue
• *Translations:* Bridge feature translations are currently missing but will be added ASAP
• *Display/UI Artifacts:* Minor visual design errors present

Message: Tari separates the miner’s token (XTM) from the ecosystem fuel (XTR):

**XTM: **Earned through CPU mining and serves as the native token for Layer 1 (Minotari).

**XTR: **Created by burning XTM at a 1:1 ratio and used for smart contracts and ecosystem applications on Layer 2 (Ootle).

**XTR consumption mechanism: **During contract execution, application operation, or infrastructure development—any on-chain activity—XTR is partially burned, introducing deflation. When XTR is depleted, you need to burn more XTM to obtain additional XTR.

This design achieves “dual scarcity”: XTM has limited issuance, and XTR is continuously reduced through use and ecosystem growth, ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of the entire system.

You can think of XTM as the “raw material” mined by miners. After burning, it is converted into XTR, which serves as the “fuel” for Layer 2. Whether you are using applications, deploying contracts, or building infrastructure, you need to consume XTR. Once XTR runs out, more XTM needs to be burned, so both tokens become increasingly scarce.

Message: Naveen, you're absolutely killing the miners! It's become far easier to just buy the coin for 5 cents on shady exchanges than to even bother firing up hardware and burning through $5 a day in electricity. What you're doing to the people who protect the network and run nodes is utterly cowardly. After 12 hours of mining, we don't even see a measly 2 XTM. Fix the pool, revert the algorithm—everything is terrible. Go back to what was working flawlessly until version 1.0.10. Just do the bare minimum! You pushed out a completely nonsensical fork, and for what purpose? The network is new; was this supposed to be our '15 days of stability'? I'm powering down GHs of equipment. I've had it! (Replying to: Hi all, shoutout to @thepinkpill for sharing this workaround for sync issues on Tari Universe for Windows:

1. Back up your seed phrase <-- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
2. uninstall Tari Universe
3. delete both "com.tari" folders in user name\AppData\Local and user name\AppData\Roaming

note: this will delete the Tari blockchain from your computer and your wallet (please back up your seed phrase before doing this or YOU WILL LOSE YOUR XTM!)

Then reinstall Tari Universe, import your seed phrase and let it resync. Hopefully this helps solve the issue for you. A few other tips thanks to the amazing @xt1085 (and their incredible Tari China community at @cntari) :

4. Change your DNS to 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8. Sometimes, local ISP DNS causes wallet sync failures.
5. Temporarily disable your antivirus software, or add Tari Universe to its whitelist. Some security programs may block wallet network connections.

Contributors are continuing to work on solving these issues in a cleaner fashion and a new update to Tari Universe will be available soon! Thank you for being a Tari OG 💜🐢)

Message: I have fired up equipment to mine XTM.
I have tried the merge-mining and it is working, I have also tried the hatchling pool and it is also working fine. And I'm getting more than 2 XTM...
Unfortunately I don't own a GPU so I can't give any answer on that. (Replying to: Naveen, you're absolutely killing the miners! It's become far easier to just buy the coin for 5 cents on shady exchanges than to even bother firing up hardware and burning through $5 a day in electricity. What you're doing to the people who protect the network and run nodes is utterly cowardly. After 12 hours of mining, we don't even see a measly 2 XTM. Fix the pool, revert the algorithm—everything is terrible. Go back to what was working flawlessly until version 1.0.10. Just do the bare minimum! You pushed out a completely nonsensical fork, and for what purpose? The network is new; was this supposed to be our '15 days of stability'? I'm powering down GHs of equipment. I've had it!)

Message: For 1,000 – 100,000 XTM, bridging usually takes between a few minutes and 12 hours, depending on network traffic. Transactions are initially capped at 100,000 XTM for security purposes. Transactions exceeding this amount will fail. There is no limit to the number of transactions you can do. This cap will increase and eventually be removed as the feature matures.

I bought on there and got it off. But they cancelled withdrawals. They are still cancelled, they didn’t cancel deposits.

Message: Tari Universe is a desktop application for mining Tari on Mac or PC. It allows users to mine Tari by utilizing their computer's computational power to solve blocks on the Tari network. This process helps secure the network while earning Tari token (XTM) rewards. Tari Universe simplifies the mining setup with features like one-click installation, a clean interface, automatic updates, and a built-in wallet. The minimum and recommended system requirements for mining include specific CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and OS specifications. For more detailed information, please refer to the Tari FAQ or official resources. (Replying to: /faq mining)

Message: If you are having trouble getting the Tari node past 3/5, it could be due to several reasons such as network connectivity issues, incorrect configuration, or insufficient system resources. Here are some steps you can try: 
1. Ensure your internet connection is stable.
2. Check your firewall settings to ensure they are not blocking the node's network connections.
3. Verify that your system meets the minimum requirements for running a Tari node.
4. Review the configuration files to ensure they are set up correctly.
5. Restart the node to see if it resolves the issue.
If the problem persists, it might be best to forward your question to support staff for further assistance. (Replying to: /faq what should I do if I can not get the Tari node past 3/5?)

--------------------------------------------------
User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-05-30 07:01:55
Message: The Tari Universe mining application does not provide an estimate of earnings because mining rewards can vary significantly based on network difficulty, your hardware's performance, and the overall network hash rate. Mining is inherently probabilistic, and rewards are distributed when a block is successfully mined. If you have concerns about your mining setup or rewards, please ensure your hardware meets the recommended specifications and consider reaching out to support staff for further assistance.

Message: The FAQ does not provide specific historical data on whether anyone has mined an entire block alone or the maximum amount of tokens mined in a single block. Generally, in proof-of-work blockchains like Tari, a block reward is given to the miner who successfully mines a block, which includes a block subsidy and transaction fees. The exact amount of tokens per block would depend on the current emission schedule and transaction fees at the time. For precise details, please refer to Tari's emission schedule or contact support staff for more information. (Replying to: /faq Has anyone ever mined an entire block alone?
