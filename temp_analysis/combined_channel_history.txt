Message: /faq how is tari connected to monero? 
--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:20:35
Message: Tari is connected to Monero through merge mining. This means that miners can mine both Tari and Monero simultaneously using the same work. Tari uses the same CPU-optimized algorithm as Monero, known as RandomX, for this purpose. This connection allows for increased security and decentralization by leveraging the existing Monero mining infrastructure. (Replying to: /faq how is tari connected to monero?)

--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:21:38
Message: Tari is connected to Monero through a process called merge mining. This means that miners can mine both Tari and Monero simultaneously using the same computational work. Tari uses a Proof-of-Work model for consensus and security, and it is specifically designed to be merge-mined with Monero using the RandomX algorithm, which is CPU-optimized and used by Monero. This connection allows miners to secure both networks while maximizing their mining efficiency. (Replying to: /faq How is tari connected to monero)

Message: /faq is there CLI miner ? 
--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:22:34
Message: Yes, there is a CLI miner for Tari. The Minotari Miner (`minotari_miner`) is used for mining Tari and enables merge mining with Monero. It connects XMRig (Monero mining software) to the Tari network to allow simultaneous mining of both Minotari and Monero. (Replying to: /faq is there CLI miner ?)

Message: /faq how to mine with minotari_miner? 
--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:23:17
Message: To mine with Minotari Miner, you need to enable merge mining with Monero using the XMRig software. First, ensure you have the Minotari Miner and XMRig installed. Then, configure XMRig to connect to the Tari network using the minotari_merge_mining_proxy. This setup allows you to mine both Minotari and Monero simultaneously. For specific configuration details, refer to the documentation provided by the Tari project or consult their community resources for assistance. (Replying to: /faq how to mine with minotari_miner?)

--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:23:50
Message: When you mine Monero together with Tari using merge mining, you are essentially performing the same amount of work as you would when mining only Monero. The difference is that you are able to submit the same proof of work to both the Monero and Tari networks, potentially earning rewards from both. However, the amount of Monero you earn should remain the same as if you were mining Monero alone, assuming the same mining conditions and network difficulty.

--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:26:55
Message: When merge mining with Tari and Monero, you can choose any Monero mining pool that supports merge mining. P2Pool is one option, but you are not restricted to it. You can select any pool that aligns with your preferences and supports the merge mining process. (Replying to: /faq when mining in merge is monero mined in p2pool or can i choose any other pool)

--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:27:39
Message: To mine Tari to an existing Tari wallet and Monero on MoneroOcean, you can use the merge mining feature of Tari. First, ensure you have the Tari Universe desktop application installed, which includes a built-in wallet for receiving mining rewards. For Monero, you can use XMRig to connect to the MoneroOcean pool. Configure XMRig to merge mine by connecting it to both the Tari network and MoneroOcean. Use the Tari wallet address for Tari mining and your Monero wallet address for Monero mining. If you need detailed setup instructions, please refer to the official Tari and MoneroOcean documentation.

Message: /faq when mining both monero and tari trough cli ... Will tari arrive directly to my tari wallet or is there some in progress function build in like in tafi universe 
--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:33:14
Message: When mining both Monero and Tari through the command line interface (CLI), the Tari rewards should arrive directly to your Tari wallet. If you are using a setup like Tari Universe, it simplifies the process by integrating the mining and wallet functions, but the core functionality of receiving mined Tari directly into your wallet remains the same. If there are specific features or functions in progress, it would be best to refer to the latest updates from the Tari project or consult with support staff for detailed information.

--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-15 21:34:14
Message: In the Tari Universe app, mined rewards go through an 'in progress' status until they reach a certain threshold, such as 2 XTM, to ensure efficient processing and minimize transaction fees. This threshold allows for batch processing of smaller amounts, reducing the frequency of transactions on the network. If you have further questions or need more details, please contact support staff for assistance.

Message: XTM is the native cryptocurrency of the Tari blockchain, which is a decentralized, privacy-focused, and scalable blockchain protocol. XTM is used as a medium of exchange within the Tari network, rewarding miners who secure the network through proof-of-work consensus. It can also be wrapped into wXTM for use on the Ethereum network, enabling interoperability with Ethereum-based applications. Additionally, XTM is used in Tari Universe for transactions and interactions within the ecosystem. If you have further questions, please let us know, and we can forward them to support staff for more detailed explanations.
