Message: /faq tokenomics 
--------------------------------------------------
Channel: OrderOfSoon | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-05-30 17:59:52
Message: Tari's tokenomics involve a total supply of 21 billion XTM, emitted gradually using an exponential decay function over approximately 27.8 years. Once annual emissions decline to 1% of total supply, a perpetual 1% tail emission will continue indefinitely to ensure ongoing miner compensation and network security. Of the total supply, 6.3 billion XTM (30%) will be pre-mined for protocol infrastructure, community incentives, grants, and contributor alignment. All newly emitted tokens after the pre-mine distribution will go exclusively to miners. More details can be found at https://tari.com/tokenomics. (Replying to: /faq tokenomics)

Message: Youd have to elaborate what you mean.....i dont quite understand your question.

The only way to store XTM at the monent is the tari wallet.
No other known wallets at the moment. 
The exchanges that listed xtm, did so on their own and there is no support provuded by the project itself on those. (Replying to: oh so it can't be stored in a wallet, okay then just use the wallet?)

Message: Tari‚Äôs built to support DeFi apps, NFTs, AI agents, digital tickets, and loyalty programs. Basically the core use cases we see across Ethereum, Solana and L1s. The big difference is confidentiality is native. Projects can build the same open apps, but with privacy baked in, which is huge for anything involving sensitive data like ownership, strategies, or user behaviour. Plus, since access to the asset layer requires burning XTM, real usage directly drives token demand and the turbine model emphasises this:) (Replying to: So what exactly is tari gonna be used for?)

Hi everyone,

Welcome to day 24 of Tari mainnet! We feel so grateful to be contributing to this revolutionary protocol with all of you. This was a big week for all of us. Together we shipped:

- Hard fork part 1!
- hatchling pool + Tari Universe integration
- Tari bridge and wXTM powered by LayerZero OFT
- lots of other small updates and tweaks!

Contributors worked tirelessly to make it all happen, and we are incredibly proud of their hard work and efforts. As we head into the weekend, we wanted to share the bugs and issues that are at the top of our list to fix ASAP next week:

üîß Top Bugs and Issues

- üì±Tari Universe Mobile - We are aware that many of you are experiencing issues with syncing, transactions disappearing, and payment ID challenges with exchanges. Our goal is to squash these bugs asap this coming week, so the mobile apps become everyone's preferred way to transact
- üåâwXTM Bridge - This new feature shipped as an MVP, and there are a number of mission-critical things we‚Äôre working on fixing including: the dreaded ‚Äúforever‚Äù transaction pending modal, providing better feedback when a transaction fails, and improving bridge performance and overall reliability
- üîóNetwork Sync - We know many of you run into a variety of challenges around network sync, including getting stuck at ‚ÄúSetting up Tari Node 3/5" and Tari Universe displaying the wrong block height. A new version of Tari base node that we hope will solve these challenges is prepped and ready for release early this coming week!
- ‚öñÔ∏è Wallet Balance Synchronization - Thank you to everyone who shared feedback on the current version of Tari Universe wallet. We‚Äôve spent significant time refactoring and improving this feature to enhance sync performance, better communicate transaction states, and more. These updates will ship very soon!

And more..! 

Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs given us feedback, shared screenshots, and submitted logs for contributors to parse. Together, we will make Tari the most useful, beautiful, and easiest to use protocol in the world üíúüê¢

Contributors worked tirelessly to make it all happen, and we are incredibly proud of their hard work and efforts. As we head into the weekend, we wanted to share the bugs and issues that are at the top of our list to fix ASAP next week:

üîß Top Bugs and Issues

- üì±Tari Universe Mobile - We are aware that many of you are experiencing issues with syncing, transactions disappearing, and payment ID challenges with exchanges. Our goal is to squash these bugs asap this coming week, so the mobile apps become everyone's preferred way to transact
- üåâwXTM Bridge - This new feature shipped as an MVP, and there are a number of mission-critical things we‚Äôre working on fixing including: the dreaded ‚Äúforever‚Äù transaction pending modal, providing better feedback when a transaction fails, and improving bridge performance and overall reliability
- üîóNetwork Sync - We know many of you run into a variety of challenges around network sync, including getting stuck at ‚ÄúSetting up Tari Node 3/5" and Tari Universe displaying the wrong block height. A new version of Tari base node that we hope will solve these challenges is prepped and ready for release early this coming week!
- ‚öñÔ∏è Wallet Balance Synchronization - Thank you to everyone who shared feedback on the current version of Tari Universe wallet. We‚Äôve spent significant time refactoring and improving this feature to enhance sync performance, better communicate transaction states, and more. These updates will ship very soon!

And more..! 

Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs given us feedback, shared screenshots, and submitted logs for contributors to parse. Together, we will make Tari the most useful, beautiful, and easiest to use protocol in the world üíúüê¢

Message: Thank you; "most of...." means 100%? (for example, I used so far Custom with 3 cores CPU out of 4, and GPU 5000 threads out of 8000 to not reach the red dots; so does Ludicrous use more? does Ludicrous overcome the red dots?). (Replying to: Eco uses less resources and will mine less XTM

Ludicrous will use most of your system resources and will mine more XTM

Custom lets you set custom settings which can result in more than ludicrous or even less than eco , depending on how you choose.)

Message: Tari Universe is a desktop application for mining Tari on Mac or PC. It simplifies the mining process with one-click setup and installation, a clean interface, automatic updates, and a built-in wallet. Tari supports merge mining with Monero using the Minotari Miner, allowing simultaneous mining of both Minotari and Monero. The Hatchling pool is a low-fee, centralized pool available to the Tari community, designed to improve the win frequency for small miners. For more detailed instructions on mining, you can use xmrig via command line or HiveOS as outlined in the FAQ. (Replying to: /faq mining)

Message: To mine Tari, you can use the Tari Universe desktop application, which simplifies the setup process for mining on your computer. Tari Universe is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their hardware or finances. It includes features like one-click setup, a clean interface, automatic updates, and a built-in wallet. Additionally, there is a 'Hatchling' pool available, which is a low-fee centralized pool to improve win frequency for miners. You can use xmrig via command line to mine using the Hatchling pool. For more detailed instructions, refer to the Tari FAQ or the Tari Universe documentation. (Replying to: /faq mining)

Message: Tari isn‚Äôt trying to replace Monero‚Äôs extreme approach to privacy ‚Äî such as mandatory RingCT, stealth addresses, and Dandelion++ for network-layer protection.
Instead, Tari uses the MimbleWimble protocol on Layer 1 to provide default transactional privacy, and builds a programmable Layer 2 ecosystem, making it more suitable for developers, creators, and real-world adoption.

Tari focuses on long-term building, privacy, and creative freedom.
Solana, on the other hand, is often referred to as the ‚Äúhigh-frequency Wall Street‚Äù of Web3 ‚Äî prioritizing speed and scalability, but at the expense of privacy and decentralization.

Technically, Tari leverages a UTXO model with MimbleWimble for efficient, private-by-default transactions, and Layer 2 smart logic for confidential assets, NFTs, and permissioned access control.
Solana uses the Sealevel parallel VM for high throughput, but lacks native privacy, has fully transparent on-chain data, and its validator set tends to be highly centralized due to high hardware requirements.

Message: **Tari separates the miner‚Äôs token (XTM) from the ecosystem fuel (XTR):

XTM**: Earned through CPU mining and serves as the native token for Layer 1 (Minotari).
**XTR**: Created by burning XTM at a 1:1 ratio and used for smart contracts and ecosystem applications on Layer 2 (Ootle).
**XTR consumption mechanism**: During contract execution, application operation, or infrastructure development‚Äîany on-chain activity‚ÄîXTR is partially burned, introducing deflation. When XTR is depleted, you need to burn more XTM to obtain additional XTR.

This design achieves ‚Äúdual scarcity‚Äù: XTM has limited issuance, and XTR is continuously reduced through use and ecosystem growth, ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of the entire system.

You can think of XTM as the ‚Äúraw material‚Äù mined by miners. After burning, it is converted into XTR, which serves as the ‚Äúfuel‚Äù for Layer 2. Whether you are using applications, deploying contracts, or building infrastructure, you need to consume XTR. Once XTR runs out, more XTM needs to be burned, so both tokens become increasingly scarce.

Message: Vale. Sigo pensando que es un problema de sincronizaci√≥n. Puede parecer que los fondos desaparecen cuando tu billetera no est√° sincronizada con la cadena.

Message: To mine Tari, you can use the Tari Universe desktop application, which simplifies the mining process with a one-click setup and installation. The application provides a built-in wallet and automatic updates. For more advanced users, Tari supports merge mining with Monero using XMRig, and you can also join the 'Hatchling' pool, a low-fee centralized pool designed to improve the win frequency for small miners. For detailed setup, you can use the command line with XMRig or configure HiveOS with the provided flight sheet JSON. Ensure your hardware meets the minimum requirements for optimal performance.

Message: In Tari, mining rewards are distributed through a coinbase transaction included in each block. The block reward consists of a block subsidy and transaction fees. The entire block reward is assigned to the miner who successfully mines the block. The reward is sent to the miner's wallet address specified in the coinbase transaction. For more details on mining and rewards, you can refer to the Tari FAQ or the Tari documentation. (Replying to: /faq tari minning recive reward)

Message: L2 has significant privacy features, but a different model. It embraces the concept of "programmable confidentiality." The idea that the system is default confidential peer to peer, however developers can create tokens where they have access to tx data. They can of course also create tokens that are entirely default confidential

the reason why Tari contributors believe strongly in this idea is to give maximum power to developers while ensuring meaningful confidentiality guarantees for Tari users. Using programmable confidentiality principles, a developer could for example build a default confidential, fiat backed stablecoin that is still compliant with alll rules and regulations

Ultimately Tari users will have tremendous control here as well. If they dont want to engage with tokens or products that have less confidentiality benefits, they don't have to (Replying to: /faq is L2 private as L1?)

Message: Tari L2‚Äôs design is quite interesting: On one hand, developers have unprecedented privacy programmability‚Äîthey can create assets and applications with different levels of confidentiality. On the other hand, users have the greatest possible choice and transparency‚Äîyou can choose to interact only with default confidential assets, or opt for apps and tokens with more transparency or compliance, depending on your needs.

The key point is that both privacy and choice are transparently handed back to users. This approach is more practical than pursuing absolute privacy alone, and it makes the ecosystem more diverse and dynamic. Developers are responsible for clear disclosure, and users make active choices‚Äîthis is what a truly healthy privacy ecosystem looks like.

Message: To mine Tari, you can use the Tari Universe desktop application, which simplifies the setup and provides a built-in wallet. Tari Universe is available for both Mac and PC, and it allows you to mine using your computer's computational power. Additionally, you can use the Hatchling pool for mining, which is a centralized pool with a low fee of 1%. For detailed instructions on mining using the Hatchling pool, you can refer to the Tari documentation or use the xmrig command line with the specified options for connecting to the pool.

Message: The FAQ does not specify a website for viewing mining statistics for the Hatchling pool. Typically, mining pools provide a dashboard or website where miners can view their statistics, but for specific information about the Hatchling pool, it would be best to check within the Tari Universe app or contact the pool operators directly.

Message: To calculate revenue from mining using the Sha3 algorithm, you can use a formula similar to the one used for RandomX, but tailored for the specifics of Sha3. Here's a general approach:

1. **Understand the Variables**:
   - **Block Reward (BR)**: The reward for mining a block, which includes both the block subsidy and transaction fees.
   - **Block Time (BT)**: The average time it takes to mine a block, which is 120 seconds for Tari.
   - **Total Network Hash Rate (TNHR)**: The total computational power of the network.
   - **Client Hash Rate (CHR)**: The computational power you contribute to the network.
   - **Network Difficulty (ND)**: A measure of how difficult it is to find a new block.

2. **Revenue Calculation Formula**:
   
   Revenue = (CHR / TNHR) * (BR / BT)

   This formula calculates your share of the network's total revenue based on your contribution to the network's hash rate.

3. **Considerations**:
   - Ensure that all units are consistent (e.g., hash rate in hashes per second).
   - Adjust for any pool fees if you're using a mining pool.

If your formula isn't working, double-check the units and ensure you're using the correct values for each variable. If issues persist, it might be helpful to consult with other developers or mining experts in the Tari community for insights specific to Sha3 mining.

Message: How to buy Tari and where to buy? (Replying to: üåê Community Update

Hi everyone,

Welcome to day 24 of Tari mainnet! We feel so grateful to be contributing to this revolutionary protocol with all of you. This was a big week for all of us. Together we shipped:

- Hard fork part 1!
- hatchling pool + Tari Universe integration
- Tari bridge and wXTM powered by LayerZero OFT
- lots of other small updates and tweaks!

Contributors worked tirelessly to make it all happen, and we are incredibly proud of their hard work and efforts. As we head into the weekend, we wanted to share the bugs and issues that are at the top of our list to fix ASAP next week:

üîß Top Bugs and Issues

- üì±Tari Universe Mobile - We are aware that many of you are experiencing issues with syncing, transactions disappearing, and payment ID challenges with exchanges. Our goal is to squash these bugs asap this coming week, so the mobile apps become everyone's preferred way to transact
- üåâwXTM Bridge - This new feature shipped as an MVP, and there are a number of mission-critical things we‚Äôre working on fixing including: the dreaded ‚Äúforever‚Äù transaction pending modal, providing better feedback when a transaction fails, and improving bridge performance and overall reliability
- üîóNetwork Sync - We know many of you run into a variety of challenges around network sync, including getting stuck at ‚ÄúSetting up Tari Node 3/5" and Tari Universe displaying the wrong block height. A new version of Tari base node that we hope will solve these challenges is prepped and ready for release early this coming week!
- ‚öñÔ∏è Wallet Balance Synchronization - Thank you to everyone who shared feedback on the current version of Tari Universe wallet. We‚Äôve spent significant time refactoring and improving this feature to enhance sync performance, better communicate transaction states, and more. These updates will ship very soon!

And more..! 

Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs given us feedback, shared screenshots, and submitted logs for contributors to parse. Together, we will make Tari the most useful, beautiful, and easiest to use protocol in the world üíúüê¢)
