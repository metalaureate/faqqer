Message: Hi All, welcome to The Order of Soon, the Tari Universe beta club :). Everyone here has been testing early versions of Tari Universe. Firstly, thank you for being our guinea pigs. We greatly appreciate it! 

Second, there is a new build coming TODAY with some big new features: design tweaks across the board, GPU support, and MORE

We'd love your help installing it, and testing it. In fact, we plan on releasing a new build daily this week leading up to Thursday. Thank you so much for all of your feedback, help and support with all things Tari and Tari Universe. We can't wait to hear what you think about the new builds this week 🙂

 TARI UNIVERSE PRE-RELEASE BETA
          v.0.2.8
==================================

Thank you friends of Soon for helping us harden the app for general release. If you successfully install/update please thumbs up, if you don't please thumbs down and we will DM you individually to help troubleshoot.

==================================
     RELEASE NOTES SUMMARY
==================================

1. Analytics and analytics permissions (in sync and settings)
   - Includes hidden gems backend update mechanisms
2. UI improvements and animation bug fixes
3. First round of Settings cleanup
4. P2Pool improvements (not yet enabled by default)

==================================
 KNOWN ISSUES WE'RE WORKING ON ASAP
==================================

1. Windows may display "unknown publisher" warnings (code signing certificates will be included in the next build) *
2. This build may not be backwards compatible with older versions *
   - If you encounter issues, you may need to Reset Settings (located at the bottom of the Settings screen)
3. Some UI messages may briefly display missing internationalization (i18n) strings *
4. Extended delay during block syncing and P2Pool operations (being addressed by the base layer contributors). Takes 3-5 minutes to sync. *
5. P2Pool is disabled by default until stabilized
6. Block win success animation sometimes does not play *
7. Older versions of Mac (pre Sonoma) may not display animations correctly
8. Anti-Virus protection may erroneously flag some components--it is safe to Allow them (working on versions that don't trigger these alarms)

* = fixed in tomorrow's build

==================================
         DOWNLOAD LINKS
==================================

Message: ==================================
     TARI UNIVERSE v0.2.10
==================================

Freshh build! This build should auto update if you close and re-open (next build won't require you to do that). (Some of you have already done this!)

INSTALLERS:

Windows: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_x64_en-US.msi
Mac: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_universal.dmg

==================================
         WHAT'S NEW
==================================

1. Auto update should update the app (have to close and open it--next build will prompt you without needing to close the app)
2. Code-signed packages for Windows
3. Fixed the block success animation
4. Startup sync improvements, shorter/more informative
5. Round 2 of Settings UI improvements
6. Tower shadows track local sun position (to surprise and delight)
7. No-click mining
8. p2pool improvements behind the scenes
9. Telemetry bug fixes

==================================
        KNOWN ISSUES
==================================

1. p2pool still stabilizing (off by default, in Settings)
2. Some sun positions expose weird graphical artifacts in the tower animation
3. Your mileage on Linux may vary at the moment (and does not support auto update)
4. Older (than Sonoma) Mac OSes exhibit issues with animations

NEXT BUILD IS TOMORROW!

Message: thank you for the feedback! re point 1, our attitude is this: every click a user makes is a miracle. Reducing clicks is always the way to make things easy. If you are opening the software, your intent is to mine, so lets just get right to it and save you the time

re 2: yes we should be able to add this in the settings. @possumously @stringhandler 

re 3: yes this should already be in the settings otherwise we can def add it. Agree with you

re 4: so there is a trade off with the graphics. The intent of this product is accessibility and creating an emotional connection for folks with Tari, which we hope the graphics help us achieve. It is definitely NOT the MOST optimized way to mine. Thats where the command line tools come in. We've debated the idea of including a version that allows you to turn off the graphics and what we settled on is this: when you minimize it, the graphics turn off and you get max performance. When its on your screen, the graphics are on and you get a small performance penalty (Replying to: Few things i personally don't like / would like to see change:

Message: just a heads up on how tomorrow is going to go. We are going to invite the top 1000 folks off the waitlist. Everyone is also going to be given 5 VIP codes to invite friends. Those codes will get them guaranteed access to Batch #2. 

Our goal for Batch #2 is to have Tari Airdrop game support added. In other words.. we are launching an incentivized testnet. You will earn (a fuck ton) of Airdrop game Gems by mining the Tari testnet. You will earn even more by inviting friends

1. Windows may display "unknown publisher" warnings (code signing certificates will be included in the next build) *
2. This build may not be backwards compatible with older versions *
   - If you encounter issues, you may need to Reset Settings (located at the bottom of the Settings screen)
3. Some UI messages may briefly display missing internationalization (i18n) strings *
4. Extended delay during block syncing and P2Pool operations (being addressed by the base layer contributors). Takes 3-5 minutes to sync. *
5. P2Pool is disabled by default until stabilized
6. Block win success animation sometimes does not play *
7. Older versions of Mac (pre Sonoma) may not display animations correctly
8. Anti-Virus protection may erroneously flag some components--it is safe to Allow them (working on versions that don't trigger these alarms)

* = fixed in tomorrow's build

     TARI UNIVERSE v0.2.10
==================================

Freshh build! This build should auto update if you close and re-open (next build won't require you to do that). (Some of you have already done this!)

INSTALLERS:

Windows: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_x64_en-US.msi
Mac: https://github.com/tari-project/universe/releases/download/v0.2.10/Tari.Universe_0.2.10_universal.dmg

==================================
         WHAT'S NEW
==================================

1. Auto update should update the app (have to close and open it--next build will prompt you without needing to close the app)
2. Code-signed packages for Windows
3. Fixed the block success animation
4. Startup sync improvements, shorter/more informative
5. Round 2 of Settings UI improvements
6. Tower shadows track local sun position (to surprise and delight)
7. No-click mining
8. p2pool improvements behind the scenes
9. Telemetry bug fixes

==================================
        KNOWN ISSUES
==================================

1. p2pool still stabilizing (off by default, in Settings)
2. Some sun positions expose weird graphical artifacts in the tower animation
3. Your mileage on Linux may vary at the moment (and does not support auto update)
4. Older (than Sonoma) Mac OSes exhibit issues with animations

NEXT BUILD IS TOMORROW!)

Message: 🚀 Tari Universe V0.3.3 Release Note 🚀

Today's release is rolling out now via autoupdate. It fixes a few bugs and adds some new animation touches, and continues getting pool mining ready.

For those new to the project, here is a reminder:

## What is Tari Universe? 🌌

Tari Universe is the world's first no-clicks-required desktop mining app. It's designed for everyone to earn Tari by contributing hash power to the Tari network, claiming their stake in a new internet of digital freedom and possibility. 💪

## Key Features 🔑

- ⚡ Instant Mining: Start mining testnet immediately with zero setup required
- 🎨 Visual Experience: Stunning visualizations of your network contribution
- 🔧 Flexible Resource Usage: Choose between Ludicrous mode (dedicated) or Eco mode (background) for CPU/GPU utilization

## What's Next? 🔮

We're continuously improving Tari Universe. In the coming weeks, expect regular updates with bug fixes and new features as we prepare for mainnet. Stay tuned for pool mining, which will democratize blockchain mining by allowing all computers to earn Tari through combined hash power and split rewards. 🤝

Join us in shaping the future of digital freedom. Welcome to the Tari Universe! 🌟

You've given us incredible feedback and we are working hard to make updates. The next few weeks will be big for Tari Universe:

next week - we hope to ship a more stable version of p2pool. This means you will earn tXTM rewards more frequently as you will be automatically connected to a decentralized pool! 

9/24 - we are planning on shipping an update that will connect Tari Universe to the Tari Airdrop Game. This means you will be able to earn Airdrop gems by mining and referring friends to Tari Universe! ALPHA: The # of Gems you will be able to earn will be HUGE!

Few question: are the tokens we mine until this connection happens being counted retroactively? As in should we just keep it all running.
Also: if we own multiple machines running nodes, will we be flagged as cybil for linking different wallets to one airdrop account? Or can all the miners point towards one wallet in the future?

Basically I want to support the network with all the machines I have lying around, but don’t want to be DQd because sybil with multiple wallets lol (Replying to: I want to give a huge shoutout to everyone here.

Message: Great question! No, tXTM has no value and no connection to mainnet tokens. This is really just for testing the software, and getting feedback from the community as we move closer towards mainnet.

That being said, starting on 9/24, we will feature on Tari Universe where you can earn Tari Airdrop Game gems through mining and via invites. At this point in time we dont expect there being any limits to how many computers etc. you run this on as the goal is to simulate a real-world mining like experience with Airdrop Gems pre mainnet launch. We will have more details on exactly how this will all work on 9/24 (assuming we dont run into any showstopper bugs of course!)

The new animation (seems a bit fast with the cube movement) in the pause mining, maybe an emoji here and there can be added to some of the rings besides the cube

As there are similar rings on the wallet balance area, will we see some animation added there?

Looks so clean. Still wondering if and how Tari Universe could play into a rainmeter app integration

If you are trying to make it a friendly experience, you may want to add a simple install mode that most will use. Then offer an advanced install mode where you can flag one client as the proxy node, then cluster the clients against the node.

When you're solo mining, it's just you trying to guess this number on your own. The thing is, there are many other miners out there, often in large groups called "mining pools," all trying to guess the same number at the same time.
Here's why you might not be seeing rewards:

It's really competitive: There are a lot of miners out there, many with very powerful computers dedicated to mining.
It's chance-based: Finding the right "number" (solving the block) is partly luck. Even if you have good equipment, you might not get lucky for a long time.

Mining difficulty: As more people mine, it gets harder to find the right solution. This is designed to keep the rate of new coins steady.

Your mining power: If you're using a regular computer or even a few specialized mining machines, your chances are still pretty slim compared to large mining operations.

Time between rewards: With solo mining, you only get a reward if you solve the block first. This can take a very long time - maybe even years - depending on your mining power and luck.

It's a bit like fishing in a huge ocean. Mining pools are like big fishing boats with huge nets, while solo mining is more like fishing with a single rod. You might catch a big fish (solve a block) eventually, but it could take a very long time.
Many miners join pools to get smaller, but more consistent rewards. In a pool, you team up with other miners and share the rewards when anyone in the group solves a block. (Replying to: Hi all, i'm happy to be part of this journey. Just a question (for now). I've been mining for an hour and my est tXTM/day shows around 15k, but my wallet balance still shows 0. How are rewards distributed? Hourly? Daily? Is it normal my balance is still at 0? I know i haven't been mining for long, but was wondering why it still hasn't moved one bit.Thanks in advance for any reply)

User: possumously | Date: 2024-09-18 19:20:18
Message: from @stringhandler : if you copy the wallet_config.json to each machine, then they will mine to the same address, but they will not have the correct seedwords. So I would recommend: 
1. Choose a master machine. 
2. Write down the seed words.
3. Restore those seeds to aurora
4a. Reset all non-master machines
4b. Do not start TU until you have done 5
5. Copy the wallet_config.json from that machine over the other machines
6. Start TU on non-masters

 the master machine will have the correct seed words, others will be junk. we'll add FAQs on this. (Replying to: Is there any docs on how to change the tari wallet address?

Message: Nice! Was curious about this. I know in the first AMA it was hinted it would be an option in the UI. Better to just do this in the meanwhile? (Replying to: from @stringhandler : if you copy the wallet_config.json to each machine, then they will mine to the same address, but they will not have the correct seedwords. So I would recommend: 
1. Choose a master machine. 
2. Write down the seed words.
3. Restore those seeds to aurora
4a. Reset all non-master machines
4b. Do not start TU until you have done 5
5. Copy the wallet_config.json from that machine over the other machines
6. Start TU on non-masters

 the master machine will have the correct seed words, others will be junk. we'll add FAQs on this.)

Message: I understand and greatly appreciate your POV, and of course efficiency matters. Even in the case of Universe we are putting a lot of effort into optimizing the graphics to use as little GPU as possible (the graphics only impact GPU). Furthermore, and this is super important: the graphics stuff turns off completely when Universe is minimized. The idea here is that we want folks who care about extracting every iota of efficiency from their setup to also feel good about running Universe!

I installed the deb, then ran `tari-universe`, and got this error: `symbol lookup error: /snap/core20/current/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0: undefined symbol: __libc_pthread_init, version GLIBC_PRIVATE`

When I run `cargo tauri dev`, I get the same error.

Message: I have good news, but I'm not sure if this is a secure solution, so it's not a recommendation. Hopefully the Tari contributors can look into the security.

After installing the alternate fuse library mentioned in the link above, I could run the AppImage for Tari Universe, and there were no adverse affects on my system. I was able to reboot and restart Universe just fine. 🥳

sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt install libfuse2
chmod +x ./tari-universe_0.3.7_amd64.AppImage
sudo ./tari-universe_0.3.7_amd64.AppImage

The console output keeps showing "Failed to get NVML", which is probably the NVIDIA Management Library, but I don't have a GPU. It just keeps outputting that error, even when GPU Mining is toggled off. It doesn't seem to be an issue, but is probably using some CPU resources that I desperately need for mining. :)

Message: Last update for the night: After Universe is running on Ubuntu for 10 mins or so, the `CPU Power` and `Est tXTM/day` fields show a spinner animation. At the same time, the console constantly repeats this message: `WARN Failed to get xmrig summary: error sending request for url (http://127.0.0.1:9090/2/summary)`

4 seconds before those warning started, the console showed this:
`INFO Selected version: 6.22.0`
`INFO Killing previous instances of xmrig`

So, I imagine that those fields come from the xmrig summary, and after the xmrig process was stopped, it appears that it was not restarted. That may also explain why my macbook has not mined a block since updating to Universe v0.3.7.

However, `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 9090` outputs:
`tcp 0 0 127.0 0.1:9090 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 9810/xmrig`

Meaning the xmrig process is running even when Universe can't get the summary. So it may be an authorization issue when calling the endpoint, which occurs after starting a new instance.

Message: Update: No blocks mined on Ubuntu w/ AMD Ryzen 9 7950X running Universe (as sudo), which typically mines at least 1 block per hour using Suite. The "Failed to get xmrig summary" error continues to repeat." Hashrate shows 18.5k for Universe, but was 21k for Suite for the 15 min ave.

I restarted without sudo this morning, and after 10 minutes, started getting the same console error repeatedly, and the same fields had spinners.

I also noticed that when running as sudo, I could not access the seed words, but when running without sudo, I could. (I understand they are separate wallets due to separate user folders/configs.)

Also, my Macbook Air running Universe, which mined over 300k in blocks before v0.3.7, has only a small mining reward from yesterday, and the `CPU Power` and `Est tXTM/day` fields show a spinner animation, same as Ubuntu. Meanwhile, my second Macbook Air, running Suite, mined 3 blocks overnight. I restarted Universe and will continue monitoring. (The fields have values again after restarting.)

The toolbar icon on the Macbook Air did not open the popup menu with hashrate, etc. (Worked fined on Ubuntu.)

Although, we have some expected bugs in a v0 product, overall I have positive sentiments because the software is easy to install and running without any system issues. Looks like some application logic is all that's needed to reach the finish line. 🏁 (Replying to: Last update for the night: After Universe is running on Ubuntu for 10 mins or so, the `CPU Power` and `Est tXTM/day` fields show a spinner animation.

Message: There does seem to be an important feature missing in Universe unless I'm just missing something obvious. Is there any way to see the transaction history, or do I need to copy the seed words and restore the wallet with the console wallet to see history?

I looked at my transactions with the console wallet and can see my P2Pool reward from yesterday (v0.3.7). That amount of Tari is in stark contrast though to the mining rewards received in previous days with earlier versions of Universe, and more so to the mining rewards received by Suite. So hopefully, this is just a temporary issue that will get resolved before mainnet.

Message: Out of curiosity, was the Tari team doing node maintenance last night? The mobile app didnt show any mining rewards. Went into the connection antennae icon, and noticed it wasn't connected to a node. I was on node five, and checked all of them, then node number one was active, and all of the queued mining rewards flowed in. I was going to write up an issue considering the issues with the difficulties of having a ui/ux friendly client, and working around the async callbacks and wait. I see some of the complexity in the client, I am impressed, seriously.

Message: I chose the MSI GTX 1660 Super Gaming over the MSI RTX 3060 Ti because it’s a better fit for my plan to run at 30% ECO mode and 50% balanced mode. While the RTX 3060 Ti excels at 100% load, it requires significantly more power. At 30%, the 3060 Ti results in a $176.25 loss over 5 years, while the GTX 1660 Super limits that loss to $12.38. At 50%, the 1660 Super turns a $375.25 profit, compared to just $6.64 for the 3060 Ti.

Ultimately, the GTX 1660 Super provides a better balance of profitability and efficiency at lower loads, making it the smarter choice for my needs.

I don't know if the xmrig error is related to the Universe prompt though. These might be separate issues.
However, if I can't run xmrig, my guess is that Universe can't mine since it needs to run xmrig.

Message: I am going to stop all of my miners for a while. Pretty sure I have been hitting blocks too often, which is probably a crappy experience for others. On a side note, you may want to create some block animation logic to stop the swastikas. They appear about every two hours or so. I have a monitor with all of the miners showing the animation, so I glance at them often. I just saw a swastika hit a block with the gold animation.

Message: Curious if anyone else running Intel  i9-14900KS's had Tari close on them overnight (last eight hours).

User: uforiaio | Date: 2024-09-27 11:22:07
Message: The i9-14900KS's are those pieces of shit that have the Intel GPU on-die /w all of the microcode issues.

User: uforiaio | Date: 2024-09-27 11:34:32
Message: Hopefully it happens again. I registered Tari to write app crashes to the Tari appdata folder, so hopefully it happens again. Before i crashed last night, I noticed that multi-gpu was working and the the 4090 and Intel GPU were both farming.

User: uforiaio | Date: 2024-09-27 11:35:28
Message: Without the crash dump I can't be certain if it is an inter-op issue with the i9-14900KS's or the dual mining, but I'll catch it next time. I loaded windbg on all of the systems and registered them to capture all exceptions.

Message: ideally it's just one of the miners and we can catch it and restart 
--------------------------------------------------
User: uforiaio | Date: 2024-09-27 12:12:06
Message: Yeah, have it flagged to restart 
--------------------------------------------------
User: uforiaio | Date: 2024-09-27 12:13:37
Message: My hunch is the fixed multi-gpu may be the cause or the damned microcode for the cpu that's been a pain.. 
--------------------------------------------------
User: uforiaio | Date: 2024-09-27 12:15:09
Message: I have the latest microcode flashed, not sure if it's public yet. It fixed the remaining issue's. Need a dmp to pass along to Intel. 
--------------------------------------------------
User: uforiaio | Date: 2024-09-27 12:16:07
Message: If it happens again, I'll update GH if it's a microcode issue with the cpu's or not.

--------------------------------------------------
User: stringhandler | Date: 2024-09-27 14:07:01
Message: There isn’t one, but it’s not hard. Basically get Tauri CLI tools installed and then run ‘cargo tauri dev’ to debug or ‘cargo tauri build’ to build
