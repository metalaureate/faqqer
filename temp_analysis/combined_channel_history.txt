--------------------------------------------------
Channel: tariproject | User: efaykue_bot | Date: 2025-06-03 07:29:37
Message: RandomX (Merge Mined) and SHA3x are mining algorithms used in the Tari blockchain. RandomX is a CPU-optimized algorithm that is also used by Monero, allowing for merge mining, which means miners can mine both Tari and Monero simultaneously using the same computational work. SHA3x is a custom algorithm based on SHA-3 (specifically SHA3-256), optimized for GPU mining, providing algorithmic diversity and broadening miner participation. These algorithms help increase the cost of 51% attacks and ensure mining decentralization and resilience against hardware centralization.

Message: The concept of a 'final fork' is not applicable to Tari or most blockchain projects, as forks can occur at any time due to network upgrades or disagreements among participants. Tari uses mechanisms like Proof-of-Work and merge-mining with Monero to minimize forks and maintain a consistent chain. If you have specific concerns about upcoming forks or network changes, please refer to official Tari channels for announcements. If you need more detailed information, your question will be forwarded to support staff for answering. (Replying to: /faq when is the final fork?)

Message: The FAQ mentions the 'Hatchling' pool, which is a centralized pool available to the Tari community for mining. It is designed to improve the win frequency for small miners and is integrated into the Tari Universe. The pool can be accessed using the xmrig command line with the following command: './xmrig.exe --donate-level 1 -o hatchlings.rxpool.net:3333 -u [YOUR WALLET ADDRESS] -k'. This pool supports GPU mining using the Tari-native RandomX algorithm. (Replying to: /faq which are the pools for gpu mining?)
