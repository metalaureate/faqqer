Message: 🚀 **TARI UNIVERSE MOBILE** (Android v1.1.4 & iOS v1.1.0) The Shell Within 

🚢 **Now live on the Google Play and iOS App Stores**

Hey everyone,

Tari contributors are excited to share the latest releases of **Tari Universe Mobile** (v1.1.4 for Android and v1.1.0 for iOS). These releases are collectively known as "The Shell Within." The Shell Within release of Tari Universe Mobile includes improved contact book behavior and a highly requested feature for both platforms.

✨ **What's New: Android**
- ☎️ **Save Exchange Addresses**: Over the last few weeks, one of our most requested features from the Tari community has been the ability to store exchange deposit addresses. Tari fam: we did it! You can now safely store exchange deposit addresses in your contact book 🥳

✨ **What's New: iOS**
- ☎️ **Save Exchange Addresses**: Just like on Android, you can now safely store exchange deposit addresses. We've also refactored the overall contact book management for smoother performance.

🐞 **Known Issues (Fixes Coming Soon)**
- iOS: The light mode toggle is currently non-functional. The app remains in dark mode regardless of your selection. You may also notice a few other visual inconsistencies. We're actively working to stabilize the iOS app and reduce overall crash rates.

📥 **Download the latest version of Tari Universe Mobile**
🔗 [tari.com/downloads](https://tari.com/downloads)
🔗 [Android GitHub Release](https://github.com/tari-project/tari-universe/releases)

Thank you to everyone who's shared feedback on the mobile apps. Together, we'll make Tari the most useful, beautiful, and easiest-to-use protocol in the world. 💜🐢

 The mining will only make full sense when the other layers are implemented which have things that most people are familiar with and enticed to interact with, being able to obtain the primary asset by mining is still great way to convince people to on-board.

Message: Tari, the coin in question (Replying to: I've navigated the crypto world for almost 10 years with KYC only recent because of circumstance.  You can use blockchain rails to circumvent everything, swapping to USDC or USDT, mining to atomic and swapping for btc. I for one have not seen any promising TVL or news about the coins adoption, dex/next addition etc)
